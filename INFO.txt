Create a linguistic-analysis tool that:
1. Measures sentence length and flags those exceeding or falling belowa definedthreshold.
2. Calculates complexity using syntactic parsing and clause counting. Suggests simplified versions for overly complex or verbose sentences. Additionally, check punctuation consistency and correctness within the document.


Label	Meaning	                                Example
advcl	Adverbial clause	                    “When she arrived, he left.”
ccomp	Clausal complement (object clause)	    “I know that he’s coming.”
xcomp	Open clausal complement (no subject)	“I want to eat pizza.”
relcl	Relative clause	                        “The man who came yesterday is here.”
csubj	Clausal subject	                        “What he said is true.”

To find number of clauses: 
Count tokens whose dep_ is in {"ROOT", "advcl", "ccomp", "xcomp", "relcl", "csubj"}
That’s exactly the set of dependency relations representing clause heads (i.e., main or subordinate clauses)
