The key guiding principle behind the functional design of CCTNS V1.0 is to focus on the critical functionality that provides value to the police personnel at the cutting edge which in turn can improve the outcomes in the areas of “Investigation of Crime” and “Detection of Criminals”.
"CCTNS V1.0 functionality is designed to focus on delivering value to IOs, records room staff and citizens within the broad crime investigation area."
"After a complaint is initiated, police initiates the investigation process."
The Investigation module of the CCTNS facilitates the investigation process and introduces operational efficiencies by automating most of the tasks that take place after initial entries are made during Registration.
Interfacing with the courts during the prosecution of cases is an integral part of the responsibilities of police personnel.
The Prosecution module of the CCTNS aids this interfacing by providing a platform to record entries of the court interactions.
"Using the search functionality, police personnel can search for a particular person, type of crime, modus operandi, property etc."
"It makes reporting easy for police by enabling them to execute different types of queries such as monthly reporting, RTI related etc."
The police in turn can use it to respond to citizens with very little turnaround time.
It improves overall productivity by helping citizens and police to cut short the drudgery of large amounts of paperwork.
The Navigation module of the CCTNS provides role based landing pages which help in navigating through the CCTNS application.
"It shows information such as cases assigned, alerts, pending tasks etc hence helping police personnel to plan better and execute with greater efficiency."
The Configuration module of the CCTNS helps keep the application configured according to the states’ requirements in addition to keeping data elements/rules up to date.
can be created updated and deleted.
The non-functional requirements specify the qualitative attributes such as user-friendliness and performance of the system that are critical for the increased user-acceptance of the application.
The solution should provide an interface for the user to log any defects or enhancement requests on the application and track thereafter.
"The solution should send alerts (e.g., email, SMS) to the user if the user chooses to whenever any action has been taken on the alert."
The solution should enable the user to track the submitted defect or enhancement request.
"The solution should enable the help-desk user to view the reports on the submitted defects or enhancement requests category-wise, status-wise, and age- wise."
"All the actions (create/read/update/delete) that are taken upon the critical entities (case, suspect, property,...) in the system"
"Once the audit trail functionality has been activated, the System must track events without manual intervention, and store in the audit trail information about them."
"The System must maintain the audit trail for as long as required, which will be at least for the life of the case to which it refers."
"The System must ensure that audit trail data is available for inspection on request, so that a specific event can be identified and all related data made accessible, and that this can be achieved by authorised external personnel who have little or no familiarity with the system."
The System must be able to export audit trails for specified cases (without affecting the audit trail stored by the System).
This functionality can be used by external auditors who wish to examine or analyse system activity.
The System must be able to capture and store violations (i.e.
"A user’s attempts to access a case to which he is denied access), and (where violations can validly be attempted) attempted violations, of access control mechanisms."
The System must at a minimum be able to provide reports for actions on cases organised:
The System should be able to provide reports for actions on cases organised by workstation and (where technically appropriate) by network address.
The System must allow the user to limit access to cases to specified users or user groups.
The System must allow a user to be a member of more than one group.
The System must allow only admin-users to set up user profiles and allocate users to groups.
The System should allow a user to stipulate which other users or groups can access cases.
"The System must allow changes to security attributes for groups or users (such as access rights, security level, privileges, password allocation and management) to be made only by super-user."
"If a user requests access to, or searches for, a case which he does not have the right to access, the System must provide one of the following responses (selectable at configuration time):"
"If a user performs a quick or advanced search, the System must never include in the search result list any record which the user does not have the right to access."
"If the System allows users to make unauthorised attempts to access cases, it must log these in the audit trail."
"Any access to cases, and all other activities involving the cases and related documents or data should also need to be stored in the audit trail to ensure legal admissibility and to assist in data recovery."
"All error messages produced by the System must be meaningful, so that they can be appropriately acted upon by the users who are likely to see them."
"Ideally, each error message will be accompanied by explanatory text and an indication of the action(s) which the user can take in response to the error."
"The System must employ a single set of user interface rules, or a small number of sets to provide a familiar and common look and feel for the application."
"The System must be able to display several entities (cases, suspects) simultaneously."
"The System user interface must be suitable for users with special needs; that is, compatible with specialist software that may be used and with appropriate interface guidelines"
The System must provide End User and Administrator functions which are easy to use and intuitive throughout.
The System must allow persistent defaults for data entry where desirable.
Frequently-executed System transactions must be designed so that they can be completed with a small number of interactions (e.g.
"Where the System employs a graphical user interface, it must allow users to customise it."
The user interfaces should be designed to make them user-intuitive.
Application user interfaces to meet its requirements and recommendations.
Content accessibility WCAG 1.0 shall be the standard used for guidance on content accessibility.
The application logo to be available on all pages as a link to the home page.
"Providing text equivalents for non-text media objects: All non-text media objects, such as graphical images or video, should be provided with alternative equivalent textual descriptions and/or with equivalent text-based functionality."
"Making navigation self-descriptive: Navigation should be designed to help users understand where they are, where they have been and where they can go next."
Showing users where they are: Each presentation segment (page or window) should provide the user with a clear and sufficient indication of where he or she is in the navigation structure and of the current segment position with respect to the overall structure.
Offering alternative access paths: Alternative access paths for navigating to a specific unit of content should be offered to support different navigation strategies.
"Minimizing navigation effort: The number of navigation steps needed to reach a certain piece of content should be minimized as long as different mental models, navigation strategies and tasks of the user are taken into account."
Splash screens should be avoided unless they provide useful content or feedback about the application state to the user.
"If a splash screen is used, a navigation option to skip it should be offered."
Avoiding opening unnecessary windows: Additional windows such as new browser windows or pop-up windows should only be opened if this supports the user’s task.
"Opening new windows can distract, confuse or impede users for a variety of reasons."
"They can superimpose the primary window, hiding relevant information."
They could make it cognitively more difficult to understand the navigation structure with negative effects on both usability and accessibility.
This may be done by placing important information at the top and providing links to information that is further down the page.
Horizontal scrolling should be avoided wherever possible.
Designing for input device independence: User interfaces should be designed to allow activation of controls by a variety of input devices.
"The ability to choose between different input devices for activating controls such as links, fields and buttons is important both for users who prefer a certain input mode, mobile users and users with disabilities."
"In general, device independence can be achieved if the functionality is operable via a keyboard."
Making user interfaces robust: User interfaces should be designed to be as robust as possible in the face of changing technology.
This encompasses being able to present content containing newer technologies by older user agents as well as designing content to be usable with future technologies.
Acceptable opening / download times: Application pages should be designed and implemented so that there are acceptable opening times and download times for the expected range of technical contexts of use (e.g.
"This is particularly important for frequently accessed pages or pages that are important for user navigation and exploration, such as the home page."
Minimizing user errors: Potential user errors as well as the effort needed to recover from errors should be minimized.
"Providing clear error messages: The content of error messages shown on the pages or special error pages should clearly state the reason why the error occurred and, if possible, actions the user can take to resolve the error."
Users expect error messages to be in the same language as the user interface.
"Using appropriate formats, units of measurement or currency: When designing user interfaces for use by diverse groups, input and output of information elements such as currency, units of measurement, temperatures, date and time, phone numbers, address or postal codes should be designed so that they are usable."
"Making text resizable by the user: Text should be able to be resized by the user, using functions provided by the user agent or other appropriate means i.e."
Text quality: The quality of textual content with respect to spelling and grammar should be sufficient so as not to impede readability.
"Writing style: The reading and understanding of the textual content on the screen should be supported by suitable means, including the use of short sentences, the division of the text into shorter chunks or the presentation of content items in the form of bullet points."
"Supporting text skimming: Fast skimming of text should be supported by the provision of clear links, bulleted lists, highlighted keywords, logical headings, and short phrases and sentences."
Readability of text: Text presented on the pages should be readable taking into account the expected display characteristics and spatial arrangement.
Distinguishable within-page links: Within-page links should be clearly distinguishable from other links that lead to a different page.
Avoiding link overload: Text pages containing large proportions of links should be formatted so that the presence of links does not impede the readability of the text.
"Using familiar terminology for navigation links: Navigation links — particularly links representing the main navigation structure — should be labelled with terms that are familiar to the user, based on his/her general knowledge, prior experience in the application domain or experience of using other systems."
"Using descriptive link labels: The target or purpose of a link should be directly indicated by its label, avoiding generic labels such as “go” or “click here” except where the purpose of the link is clear from its context on the page or the labels have commonly understood semantics in the particular application domain."
Using appropriate terminology specific to the user’s tasks and information needs is important for making the content easy to understand.
Marking links opening new windows: Links that open new browser windows or pop-up windows should be clearly marked.
Distinguishing navigation links from controls: Navigation links should be clearly distinguishable from controls activating some action.
"Typical action types in user interfaces include manipulating application data, performing searches, communication actions, such as opening a new e-mail window or starting a chat function, and presentation-related actions, such as sorting a list of search results."
"Providing printable document versions: If a document is either too long, dispersed over several pages or in a specific layout that is not suitable for online reading, a printer-friendly version of the document should be provided that prints the content in a form acceptable to the user (e.g."
space filled only with the background color should be used in such a way that it does not impair the visual skimming of the page.
"While white space is an important means of visually organizing the different content elements on a page, if the distance between the blocks of information displayed becomes too large, rapid skimming of the page can be impeded."
Selecting appropriate page lengths The length of a page should be selected so as to support the primary purpose and use of the page.
"Short pages are generally more appropriate for homepages, navigation pages, or overview pages that need to be read quickly."
Longer pages can be more appropriate when users want to read the content without interruptions or when the page needs to match a paper counterpart.
"Using colour: Colour should be used with care, taking into account human capabilities and restrictions in perceiving colour, and not as the only means of conveying information."
"Using frames with care: If frames are used, care should be taken to avoid possible problems, for example, those involving the use of the back button, bookmarking of pages, or scrolling of information."
"When frames are used, it is important to title each frame, and to describe its purpose and how frames relate to one another other."
"Providing alternatives to frame-based presentation: If frames are used, an alternative way of presenting relevant information without frames should be provided."
"Providing alternative text-only pages: When style sheets and/or frames are turned off it should be possible for the user to read and understand the page; alternatively, the user should be provided with an equivalent alternative text-only page."
"Consistent page layout: Pages should be designed using consistent layout schemes, supporting the user in finding similar information at the same position on different pages."
Overall layout schemes apply to all pages and are preferable when all pages have a similar structure.
"In such cases, pages can usually be grouped in different categories, using one layout scheme for each category consistently."
Placing title information consistently: Page titles should be placed in a consistent location on the different pages.
"Observing principles of human perception When designing application pages, the general principles of human perception should be taken into account."
Practical guidelines for presenting information to the user are to be found in ISO 9241-12.
Guidance on selecting and using different forms of interaction techniques is to be found in ISO 9241-14 to ISO 9241-17.
"In addition, when designing multimedia information presentations, the design principles and recommendations described in ISO 14915-1 to ISO 14915-3 should be taken into account."
Linking back to the home page or landmark pages: Each page should contain a link leading to the home page of the application or to a landmark page that is easy to recognize for the user.
Providing a site map: A separate navigation overview such as a site map should be provided for application showing the structure of the site in an overview form.
"Consistency between navigation components and content: If navigation components (or overviews) are shown in conjunction with associated content, consistency between the navigation component and the content shown should be maintained by indicating in the navigation component (e.g."
highlighting) the topic currently visible in the content area.
Placing navigation components consistently: Navigation components should be placed consistently on the pages or in the framesets in the pages of the application.
Individualization and user adaptation : Adapting the content and the navigation of a user interface to individual users or user groups can be a useful mechanism for providing information that is of interest to the users and for making access to relevant information more efficient.
User adaptation can also be important for making the user interface more accessible.
"such as employees of different levels, citizens etc, monitoring the user’s behaviour and adapting to the user’s goals that are inferred from the behaviour observed, recommending information that is potentially more relevant or interesting to the specific user, based on the behaviour of all users or a user group."
"Taking account of the users’ tasks and information needs: When providing different access paths or navigation structures for different user groups, the tasks and information needs of these user groups should be taken into consideration."
Making individualization and adaptation evident: It should be made evident to the user when individualization and/or adaptation are used.
"Making user profiles evident: If predefined user profiles or user-specified profiles are used for individualizing or adapting content, the profile currently used should be made evident."
"If profiles are used, it is important to provide users with information about this concept and its implications."
"Allowing users to see and change profiles: If user-specified profiles are used, users should be able to see, modify and delete that profile on demand."
The System is considered to be down if any user is unable to perform any normal System function and if this failure is attributed to any component of the System other than the workstation.
Unplanned downtime for the System must not exceed <xx hours/minutes> per <rolling three month period>.
The number of incidents of unplanned downtime for the System must not exceed <x> per <rolling three month period>.
"In the event of any software or hardware failure, it must be possible to restore the System (with inline synchronization) within no more than <xx> hours."
The System must be able to perform a simple search within 5-8 seconds and a advanced search (multiple search criteria) within 10-15 seconds regardless of the storage capacity or number of cases in the system.
"In this context, performing a search means returning a result list."
It does not include retrieving the records themselves.
"The System must be able to retrieve and display within 5-8 seconds the case which has been accessed within the previous 2 months, regardless of storage capacity or number of cases in the system."
"This requirement is intended to allow for rapid retrieval of frequently-used cases, on the understanding that frequency of use is typically correlated with recent use."
"The System must be able to retrieve and display within 20 seconds the case which has not been accessed within the previous 2 months, regardless of storage capacity or number of cases in the system."
This requirement is intended to allow for cases where cases used infrequently are stored on slower media than more active records.
"The System be scaleable and must not have any features which would preclude use in small or large police stations, with varying numbers of cases handled."
The proposed functional architecture is modeled around centralized deployment to facilitate ease of maintenance and leverage advancement in open standards and web technologies.
Each of the components contains multiple services as defined by Service Definition.
"The system should be designed in manner that operational data is not lost in case of any
                failure of equipment or communication network."
"The system should be designed to have satisfactory performance even in Police Stations
                connected on low-bandwidth"
"The system should be implemented using Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and have a
                modular design"
"The system should be built on a common User Access and Authentication Service to
                ensure Single-Sign on for the end-user"
The system should be developed to be deployed in a 3-tier datacenter architecture
"The system should be designed to have a n-tier architecture with the presentation logic
                separated from the business logic that is again separated from the data-access logic"
"The system should be extensible to provide access to the interfaces through PDA’s and
                mobile data terminals"
The system should support multi-tier authentication where required
"The system should use HTTPS as the communication protocol, i.e., HTTP over an encrypted secure socket layer (SSL)"
The system should ensure secure transmission of data over the network and utilize SSL and 2-way digital signatures
Use of AJAX based technology to improve user experience.
Aggressive page loading to be considered based on the screen and estimate usage pattern
"The search results should be fetched from the database in batches of 10 or 20 maximum
                    as configured within the application"
The search should fetch only the fields that need to be displayed to the user.
"Only when
                    the user clicks on a particular record to view its further details should a query be fired to
                    fetch the additional details for this particular record only"

"The goal of the SRS is to provide a functional tool for 
guiding the development of controls and data acquisition systems in a manner consistent with their operation within the Gemini System."
"As such, it logically follows the Operational Concepts document, which addresses the control of the Gemini system from a more general 
perspective."
"This is the on-site person responsible for monitoring the data acquisition
and validating the data integrity being collected for the astronomer, as well as ensuring
that the science plan is functioning to the needs of the astronomer."
"This person
is responsible for ensuring the integrity of the system and for keeping the system functioning
accurately during observations."
"The Telescope Operator works with the Observer and
the science plan to produce as good data as is possible."
"They work with other users to determine
appropriate observation scheduling changes, maintenance down-time, and system
modifications."
"It is possible that a particular individual would fall into several of the
categories."
"For example, it is not unusual for the astronomer to also be the science
observer."
"The Gemini system, when powered on, exists in one of several disjoint operational 
levels."
"This is a special, read-only case of the observing mode that can be
invoked on a subsystem basis."
"It is normally available only to the Telescope
Operator and the science program sequencer when at operation level."
"Actual
access to the telescope is not permitted in this mode, but the virtual telescope capability of
the Gemini system provides a telescope simulator that is useful for planning observations,
as are on-line databases."
"Under no circumstances should testing affect the performance
of an ongoing observation."
"It is possible to inquire about system utilization, efficiency, etc."
"No control is available in this mode, only status and scheduling
information is accessible."
"It is entirely possible for a single user to be accessing the system through several modes
simultaneously."
"In fact, this is the typical situation with the Telescope Operator, who is
often concurrently accessing the system through the observer, monitor, and operator
modes."
"There are times when an astronomer might be using both observer and monitor
modes."
"It is from here that nightly operations
would take place."
This is the facility where off duty personnel reside while stationed on the summit.
"This would be the Hale Pohaku facility on Mauna Kea and Cerro Tololo in Chile
(assuming no support facility is constructed on Cerro Pachon)."
"This is the facility where offices, shops, etc."
"These are super sites, in general located in partner countries, which have direct links
to the telescopes via communications lines."
"Although they have remote operations capability, the link capacity will determine
at what level."
"Unless the contrary is explicitly stated, all requirements and modes presented are
intended to be available to all users of the system."
"It should also be noted that what the system has to guarantee in terms of operations
must fulfill all possible requirements, but it does not mean that all features will be
made available to all users at all locations at all times."
"The available capabilities will have to be adapted to the operational needs both
locally and remotely and these decisions can only be taken later in the life of the
project."
"Purpose of work
Whatever their level of experience, observing astronomers will wish to concentrate
on the efficient acquisition of astronomical data and on-line assessment of data quality,
rather than on the details of controlling the telescope and instruments."
"To allow observing astronomers to achieve this objective, the system must offer to a
user an interface which, while fulfilling the various operational requirements in the
different modes and offering status information both automatically and on request at
any required level, is still simple to learn and secure in its use."
"Privileges
Observing astronomers shall have no privileges as far as the direct control of the telescope
is concerned."
"They shall not be able to send control commands directly but they must be
able to enquire about the status of the telescope or any subsystem at any time."
"The intent is
not to restrict the capabilities of the observing astronomer in any way but rather to establish
a single point of control and responsibility."
"Programs, as opposed to observers, may
have the capability of direct control of the telescope."
"This would allow the observer to create
an observing program which requested a telescope control function but would not
allow the observer to enter (for instance) a command to slew the mount."
"This is essential to support operational requirements such as service observing
and flexible scheduling (as defined later in Section 2.7 on page 2-12)."
"A certain degree of interaction shall be provided, meaning in this case that the user will
interact with the scheduler program, rather than with the control programs directly."
It must also be possible to break and resequence this queue.
"In particular, Operations staff will be able to enable direct interactive operation, but this
shall not be considered as the normal operation mode for the reasons explained in
Section 2.7 on page 2-12."
"It is evident that, for some functions (such as adjustment of
spectrograph slit width for seeing conditions) it must be necessary to include interactive
capability."
"Only after experience has been gained with the
system will the existence of the queue become evident to the on site observer."
"Depending on the operations implemented on the Gemini 8m Telescopes, they may
become telescope operators, operations supervisors of the Gemini 8m Telescopes telescope,
and instrument operators and have to overview the Gemini 8m Telescopes operation."
"They will supervise telescope operation and will
be able to advise observing astronomers on what they have to do to use telescope and
instruments efficiently."
"Privileges
Operations staff shall have privileges to access all commands and maintenance procedures
in case of problems."
"However, they shall not have access to subsystems while these are in normal operation."
"If they need to access other parts of the system appropriate reconfiguration procedures
have to be run."
"Operation mode
Operations staff shall have access to operation tables in update mode, while observing
astronomers will have access to them only in read mode (for example the list of
filters mounted on an instrument)."
"Again, the intent is not to restrict the capabilities of
the observing astronomer in any way but rather to establish a single point of control
and responsibility."
"At the present time it is not clear how to handle visitor instrument
requirements in this area."
"They shall be able to change the operational status of units according to the results of
tests performed on such units (e.g."
"to see if a faulty unit can be declared as operational
again and redefined as part of the environment in use)."
"Definition
Software development and maintenance are staff:
•based either at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site or base facility, or
•based at the Gemini 8m Telescopes remote operations facility, or
•non Gemini staff from a contract company or from an associated Institute."
"These users will have a deep understanding of the way the Gemini 8m Telescopes
software works."
"Purpose of work
Software development and maintenance staff intervene when there is a major problem
to be solved or an upgrade to be installed."
"Privileges
Software development and maintenance staff need the highest privilege in order to be able
to modify everything in the system."
"Nevertheless strict configuration control guidelines
must be followed to prevent interference with ongoing normal operation."
"Operation mode
Software development and maintenance staff usually work at the test level 
(see Section 3.2.1.3 on page 3-4) for the part of the software under test."
"Other parts of the Gemini 8m Telescopes may also need to run in test mode
 to support integration tests."
"This means that a number of commands are available 
which allow the hardware concerned to be tested 
(test commands) and are not accessible to observing astronomers."
"This section derives directly from Gemini 8m Telescopes program requirements 
and speciﬁes the operational context, which is a direct consequence of the structure of the Gemini 8m Telescopes system."
The Gemini 8m Telescopes operation has to cope with a complex environment produced by:
"Although there are two telescopes as part of the 
Gemini system there are no plans to support concurrent use 
of them as if they were a single facility."
"It is, however, a long term goal 
of the Gemini project to be capable of being used in conjunction with nearby, 
perhaps non-Gemini, telescopes on the same site (for instance for interferometry)."
"Parallel access to all the mounted instruments shall be provided, though only 
one instrument has access to the telescope beam (active instrument).Instruments 
which feed two detectors by using beam splitters or ﬁeld splitters is considered as a 
single active instrument."
"Feeding two separate instruments via beam splitters or 
ﬁeld splitters and providing separate control nodes is not a requirement."
they shall be able to take calibration or ﬂat ﬁeld exposures in parallel
"they shall be able to prepare for an exposure to start as soon as the telescope beam is switched back 
to them (in this case, they are in a hot standby situation)"
"they shall be able to work; at all foreseen operation levels 
(observing, maintenance, test) (see Section 3.2.1 on page 3-3)."
"Regardless of the status of an inactive instrument, it shall not be possible for any of its permitted 
actions to adversely impact the active instrument"
Due to the specialized nature of visitor instrumentation it is unlikely that complete integration into the Gemini environment is either feasible or warranted.
"The Gemini Telescopes view all instruments as operating as servers, responding to commands from the upper levels of the system."
Visitor instruments must be capable of operating in this mode to be adequately supported.
"maintenance of operations tables (such as ﬁlter lists) which
 can become part of an observation's permanent record"
"Due to the nature of visitor instrumentation it is unlikely that 
more complicated functionality can be supported."
"This does not mean that more complicated functionality will not be 
possible for visitor instruments that require it."
"As more complicated functionality 
will be supported via standardized interfaces for the Gemini instruments, such 
as coordinated motions, it should be possible to adapt visitor instruments to this 
standard."
"The difﬁculty with offering such services as an externally supported standard, 
as opposed to an internally supported standard, is that decisions to change internal 
standards do not impact external users."
"It is important that the visitor instrument interface be stable and long-lived, as the 
time between successive uses of the same visitor instrument can be as long as one or two years."
"The support of visitor instrumentation is made simpler if the visitor equipment 
adheres to the Gemini standards."
"the evolution of Gemini standards might require existing visitor instruments 
to rewrite or rework large areas of their control system"
"visitor instruments built later in time than the initial complement of 
Gemini instruments may want to take advantage of different and/or less
 expensive technology if it better suits the goals of their project"
"For these reasons it is probably not possible to establish a combined standard to which all instruments, 
both Gemini and visitor, adhere to completely."
"It is much better to establish a subset of Gemini facilities which will be
 made available to visitor instruments via long lived, stable interfaces."
"The requirements to have instruments operated as single units 
imply that several user stations will be active at the same time on the Gemini 
8m Telescopes."
"Independently of the location of users at the telescope site, they shall be able to access
 (according to their privileges) any part of the whole setup with a simple logon and conﬁguration operation."
"By this it 
is meant that, while some (active) user is in control of the Gemini 8m Telescopes, someone 
else can follow what they are doing by monitoring all the relevant data from telescope and 
instruments."
"All other users wishing 
to monitor Gemini 8m Telescopes operations have to go through the procedures set up by 
Operations and get permission to do so."
"The multi-point monitoring mode might also be important when certain difﬁcult or rare problems 
occur, when expert advice is needed and can only be obtained from colleagues situated remotely."
"Multi-point monitoring allows them to follow directly the results of tests performed and 
investigate how the system is working (e.g."
"Multi-point monitoring also allows a local observer to be monitored and advised by a remote 
supervisor."
".There is a visual user interface to the OCS to allow for changes to the viewing 
program."
It is possible to have more than one station participate in the observing.
"It is therefore an essential requirement
 that telescope operation is supported by the software in a smooth and very friendly way 
in this mode."
"Interaction will normally be via an automatic sequencer 
(see Section 2.5.9 on page 2-6)."
"This is clearly a top priority requirement and one 
which will have to be realized before implementing any other mode."
"The initial implementation 
of the automatic sequencer will operate in a “pass through”mode where
 all commands are accepted and transmitted with
 minimal checking and delay."
"Queue-based observing is the primary observation mode used with the Gemini 
telescopes, as it is the best means of providing sound science data while maximizing 
efﬁcient use of the telescope."
"While its requirements include all those given below for service 
observing, it has the following special requirements."
"The observing program must be fully automated, requiring very little human 
interaction during the observation."
"The means that the Gemini software must include 
a sufﬁciently rich programming environment to make this feasible."
"In addition, this should 
be a visually-oriented environment providing a simple, 
easy-to-use interface to the astronomer."
"There should be a full telescope simulator to enable the astronomer
 to test observing programs for completeness, errors, and functionality."
"There is a requirement for software to assist in object selection both 
within an observing program and across observing programs, in order to optimize 
observing efﬁciency."
"There must be software to support the ﬂexible scheduling, both 
manually and via a scheduler, allowing for the interleaving of observing 
programs in a manner that is transparent to the individual observing 
programs."
"This includes managing the collection of science, 
environmental, engineering, reference, and calibration data."
"To maximize the use of the available observing time it must
 be possible to queue all of the observing that is possible with the
 currently available instruments."
"It should be possible to resort 
the queue so that the next observation to take place comes to the front
 of the queue."
"This sorting will be based on properties of the individual 
observing sequences, current site conditions, and other rules established 
by the observatory directorate.While these rules have yet to be worked 
out one could imagine rules such as “no more than 15% of observing 
will be preempted” or “a 10% overhead to the prime observing project 
is acceptable in order to pick up observations in similar parts of the 
sky with identical ﬁlters”."
"As the costs of implementing 
such a scheduler are currently difﬁcult to estimate it may prove 
necessary to implement it in a future phase of the project."
"The system design, 
if it does not include a scheduler, should speciﬁcally allow for its future 
implementation."
All software should be developed to permit remote operations.
"It should 
be possible to do full operations remotely"
"Team observing, with multiple observers at different sites should 
be supported."
It must be possible to restrict speciﬁc operations to speciﬁc remote sites.
"The method used to restrict such operations should be
independent of the operations themselves, and dynamic."
It is assumed that the hardware involved in remote operations has been speciﬁed with sufﬁcient bandwidth to support remote operations.
"The choice of the name remote operations is meant to suggest an entire category of operations, such as remote observing but also remote access for diagnostic support."
"It is only necessary that the functionality of the system be transparent, it is accepted that the speed of the link will determine the perceived transparency of the system."
"It is required that the remote operations software be considered from the 
beginning in the Gemini 8m Telescopes software design, to avoid redesign later."
"This should reduce the amount of speciﬁc software needed for remote operations, 
as the common layers of software shall cope from the beginning with a 
distributed environment."
"Remote control means that the function normally associated with a
 local Telescope Operator, that of entering telescope control commands, would be
 available from a remote site."
"The philosophy
behind this is that, for safety considerations, telescope control commands cannot be issued 
without a staff member (not necessarily the same person) having direct access to:"
"Remote observing means that users shall be able to observe from a
 remote site such as Cerro Tololo, Hilo or even home Institutes."
"This possibility 
has to be provided on the Gemini 8m Telescopes."
"The extent to which realistic observing conditions can be reproduced depends,
 of course, largely on the link bandwidth available."
"Experience with previous 
telescopes at other
OBSERVING MODE REQUIREMENTS
observatories shows, however, that, even with very limited bandwidths, 
remote observing can be implemented, provided the software is suitable for this."
"Remote observing, as meant in this context, does not mean remote control."
"In the last case they will use a remote User interface to 
submit commands to the Gemini 8m Telescopes scheduler at the Gemini 
8m Telescopes site."
"It is a requirement for the Gemini 8m Telescopes
operation and will complement service observing, making it friendlier for users."
"Remote 
monitoring coincides to a large 
extent with multipoint monitoring, 
but allows the remote user to “pick and choose” the information that is displayed
 on the remote screen."
"A remote observer might also need a real-time video and voice link with the operator
 in the control room, perhaps using a portable video camera which the operator can 
position as necessary."
"It is assumed this facility is provided entirely by hardware, and 
is beyond the scope of the Gemini software."
This might be necessary to back up local users expertise and to help in case of problems.
"Distributed access to the Gemini 8m Telescopes software, once implemented."
"Service observing implies that the Gemini staff 
are responsible for performing the actual data collection for the astronomer."
"A special case of service observing, queue-based, is given earlier, and assumes 
that the observing program can be executed with minimal interaction with the client 
astronomer."
"The more general case, where a science observer is present on site and the client 
astronomer is remotely connected, is considered here."
"The observing program must be automated, requiring little human 
interaction during the observation."
"The means that the Gemini software 
must include a sufﬁciently rich programming environment to make this feasible."
"In addition, this should be a visually-oriented environment providing a simple, 
easy-to-use interface to the astronomer."
"The programming environment should allow for the 
communication of special notes, instructions, and comments 
from the astronomer to the observer, possibly involving multimedia techniques."
"Observing, as such, is the purpose of the Gemini 8m Telescopes system."
"But interactive observing is perhaps, in some cases, not the most efﬁcient way to achieve 
this, although it will be necessary for certain kinds 
of observations (such as adaptive optics) and in certain phases (such as commissioning 
and test periods)."
"Service observing, on the other hand, means that the observing 
program can be performed by someone other than the proposing
 astronomer."
"It will be done on his behalf at a convenient moment 
that is not exactly predeﬁned and may be intermixed with programs from other users."
Service observing requires switching during the night among telescope modes and instruments.
"This might typically be a few times (2) per night, when sky conditions change."
"It requires also that the observing program is so well speciﬁed that it can be executed by 
someone else."
"Service observing requires a suitable organization to support it, and ﬁrst of all, considerable 
experience with a smooth running system."
"For these reasons it can only be applied to the 
Gemini 8m Telescopes once the Classical observing requirement has been fulﬁlled and been 
in operation for a while."
"Nevertheless, the software and data structures to support classical 
observing which have to be present in a system that is only interactive at the start might 
require considerable redesign to be adapted later to the service observing requirement"
"To achieve efﬁcient service observing, queue observing, and ﬂexible scheduling, 
it should be possible to carry out observations automatically, in accordance with predeﬁned 
sequences of exposures, as is commonly done in space observatories."
"This corresponds to what is meant by planned observing, which still requires competent 
monitoring at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site or remotely."
"At the same time, one does not want to lose the advantages and the extra
ﬂexibility of ground-based astronomy."
"So whichever scheme is adopted to
perform automatic sequences, interaction shall be allowed at the desired 
level (for example, only on error conditions, 
any time the user is allowed to break a sequence, etc."
"It will require the use of service and/or remote observing, as 
users cannot stay around indeﬁnitely waiting for the conditions required by 
their program."
"This can be complemented by remote monitoring, if users can be 
on standby at a suitably equipped remote site."
"Flexible scheduling requires the possibility to change telescope scheduling 
quickly, exchanging observing programs."
"This can be achieved only with the 
help of appropriate scheduling software, which must advise the operations team 
on the best choice to make which is compatible with the relative priorities of the 
various observing programs."
"It should be recognized that such ‘expert scheduling’ 
software does not currently exist - it should be a requirement of such software that 
it have an operational mode which merely supports the decision making process by 
presenting appropriate information."
"Flexible scheduling requires switching during the night among telescope modes and 
instruments (typically 2 times per night)."
"These requirements apply to the commands and replies 
between sub-systems (including status information requests and replies), 
information ﬂow to and from on-line databases, and commands 
and software for the IOCs."
"The syntax of control ﬂow commands is to be consistent 
across the system, whether accessing workstation software or IOC software."
"All subsystems must respond to a common set of commands 
to test operational status, inquiries as to version, perform self-tests, etc."
"Handshaking of commands between IOCs must occur within 100-200 msec, 
signaling acceptance of each command."
"Peak control information within the system is 
expected to be 100 TPS."
"This assumes bridging between 
communication sections, to isolate trafﬁc in relevant sections only."
"For focusing and related activities, maximum acceptable detector readout time
 is about 0.1 sec, though only a portion of the detector may be read during that time."
"Since the Gemini system supports 
monitoring of operation, there must be the capability of providing multiple, 
simultaneous access to data."
"Data transfer between the virtual telescope system and 
attached workstations therefore imposes signiﬁcant transfer requirements on the LAN."
"Data is normally acquired as uncompressed data,
 but may be compressed using a loss-less compression technique for transmission 
from the Gemini system or across the system LAN."
"The goal of compression is to minimize 
bandwidth impact on the LAN and WAN and to save space on 
removable media."
"For data that requires preprocessing, such as infrared detector data, 
only the preprocessed data is stored."
"Data from all instruments and detectors is stored as compressed
 data, using a standard format."
"There is a ﬁrst level of storage within IOCs, to secure data in the event of 
link failures.A second level of storage is on the Gemini system data disk(s), possibly
 also on removable media."
"Quick-look data quality assessment is 
done using this level."
"Data is transmitted between Gemini and home Institutes
 using a FITS format and contains all header information provided with the data."
"The system data capacity is capable of retaining 7 days of data produced by the largest 
instrument, the last 3 days of which must be available interactively from hard disk or 
similar medium."
"To preserve the integrity of the system, there must be a system of privileges 
established at each operating level of the system."
"Protection against accidental interference is to be implemented using an Access Mode Allocation 
system that dynamically identiﬁes and assigns resources as needed."
"Critical resources 
(those that can support only a restricted number of simultaneous uses) are assigned solely 
through this allocation system."
"The allocation system must ensure that the system cannot 
remain deadlocked with respect to this resource allocation."
"Finally, procedures must be implemented for convenience and system integrity, to simplify 
and codify common tasks."
The tasks that require such procedures include:
"This is not permitted to interfere with telescope 
operation."
"Instrument self-testing and self-diagnosis This is not permitted to interfere with 
telescope operation"
"The control software should know what subsystems are installed 
and their status at all times."
"The telescope and instrument software shall contain built-in test (BIT) 
facilities to verify Gemini 8m Telescopes system and Gemini 8m Telescopes software 
performances."
"Every Gemini 8m Telescopes software module shall have corresponding test speciﬁcations 
to check normal operation of releases, to be used both for acceptance tests and as an on-line 
test procedure."
Subsystems must notify the user when faults occur.
"This notiﬁcation must be 
speciﬁc as to origin and problem."
"It may also prove useful to have multiple levels of fault notiﬁcation such as detailed, 
verbose, short, etc."
"one detector, one instrument) predeﬁned 
procedures must exist to redeﬁne the environment in such a way that operation can 
restart with the remaining equipment."
"In case of computer hardware failure concerning the user station equipment, it shall 
be possible to transfer control from one user station to another via a simple software 
reconﬁguration procedure."
"In this case there shall be 
a procedure to replace faulty cards and/or assemblies."
"If it is possible to observe with that 
particular IOC in a failed state (in general, this is limited to IOCs that are associated with 
individual scientiﬁc instruments) then it must be possible to reconﬁgure the system 
to do so."
"Full redundancy is not a requirement of the Gemini 8m Telescopes and it will 
be acceptable to have to replace units in case of failure."
"There are subsystems which are relatively inexpensive to support as redundant systems, 
such as telescope control computers."
"For each area where redundancy is decided to be cost 
effective, procedures for switching to the backup system will be established."
"All communication shall be based on the use of standard communication protocols, where 
retry procedures are applied (a form of software redundancy) as part of the protocol."
"Certain network concepts may be preferable as they offer intrinsic redundancy 
(e.g."
"Commercial packages, off-the-shelf
 public domain software, and standards are to be used whenever feasible."
"All Gemini software is to be developed using standard methodologies
 and development environments."
"One of the goals of Gemini software is that all 
components be easily (preferably automatically) combined into 
an integrated system."
"Gemini software developers should maintain accurate change logs 
showing software modiﬁcations as they are applied to the system software."
"Gemini software should be developed
 in evolutionary fashion, using the CVS version control system"
"All Gemini subsystem packages should include as part of the software 
both a simulator module for inclusion in the virtual telescope (see Design constraints, below), 
and user interface modules for the user interface environments that the subsystem will be 
operating in."
"All Gemini software is to be fully documented, internally with appropriate comments, 
and external documentation."
"It is likely that different user interface modules (see above) would present 
different portions of this functionality to the user."
"The version information is to be retrievable from executing 
software via control commands."
"Also, the use of a virtual-telescope model in the Gemini system means that 
the integrated system can be tested and developed independently of the target hardware."
"Therefore all hardware subsystems must provide a software
 simulation module (as stated earlier) that responds in reasonable fashion to commands 
directed at that hardware."
".Gemini subsystem should be as self-contained and autonomous as possible, 
thereby decreasing the functional width of the interface 
to the rest of the Gemini system."
"To achieve this, many other data concerning the telescope and instruments (parameters) 
and control commands will have to be exchanged between different processing units in 
order to setup and control telescope and instruments."
"Control information must be transferred, typically in the form of commands 
and replies from users, to telescope and instruments."
"No request for information shall produce a delay
 of control activities or locking, even if the corresponding equipment is not available or faulty."
"Delay times for the exchange of control information must stay within precise time limits 
to be deﬁned in “General Description” in Chapter 2."
"One can afford to retransmit commands 
in case of transmission error or collision, but the protocol has to be predictable in that
 commands cannot get lost and replies have to come back reliably."
"It is explicitly required that all such information is available to the Gemini 8m Telescopes 
software and is capable of being available to all users of the Gemini 8m Telescopes, subject 
only to restrictions with respect to updating."
"It must also be possible to restrict user access 
to such information."
"Detector data must be acquired and stored in the most effective way technology
 will allow; effectiveness should be evaluated in terms of cost, space requirements, longevity, 
and speed."
"This shall lead to the deﬁnition of a Gemini 8m Telescopes standard, used on all 
instruments."
"In general, operational overheads must be kept as low as possible, to maximize 
actual observing times."
"However, there must be at least two
copies - one to secure data as acquired and one to do assessment of data quality on-line 
(this last copy preferably on removable media)."
"The link chosen to transfer data should 
represent as small a bottleneck as possible for data acquisition."
"There might, however, be cases (for example, infrared detectors) where fast preprocessing is 
needed and where, therefore, raw data will not be stored
 as such, but in a preprocessed format."
"Astronomical data will have to be transported between GEMINI and 
the home institutes of visiting astronomers in FITS format (as deﬁned by NOST 100-1.0,
 “Deﬁnition of the Flexible Image Transport System (FITS)”, NASA Science Ofﬁce of Standards
 and Technology)."
"TV data concerning site monitoring and voice need to be capable of being 
available at all operations facilities."
"It is not a 
requirement that point to point video be available between Gemini 8m Telescopes operations
 facilities."
"It is a requirement that voice connectivity, perhaps point to point, be available
 on a permanent connection."
"There will be parameters associated with each level of operation 
which deﬁne the status of the system and / or control the system."
It is anticipated that all user categories have access to this level.
"This allows maintenance
 tables (for example, with instrument parameters) to be updated."
"It is anticipated that the 
majority of parameters at this level will be accessed by 
operations and development staff."
"It shall be possible to update
 all non-protected parameter values, i.e."
"Privileges and protections are also important parameters
 to deﬁne user operations."
"For example some users might only be allowed monitoring, as 
a subsystem is in use by someone else."
"Protections must also be enforced (see also Security in Section 3.5.6
 on page 3- 20) among users and the operational software should indicate clearly
 to users the current operation level and check the compatibility between subsystems
 in different modes."
"The capacity of the system can be expressed in terms of nodes, which is deﬁned 
as the number of workstations, or in terms of users, which is deﬁned as the sum total of users 
at all the nodes."
"When the Gemini 8m Telescopes telescope is used in its normal observing mode, there will be 
a single operator node for the telescope and two data acquisition and instrument control nodes."
"OPERATION
Some tests might be run in parallel on instruments that do not have the light beam at that 
moment, so in principle additional nodes might be working at the same time."
"The system will provide for a 
single off-site data acquisition and instrument control node - to be located at either the 
Gemini 8m Telescopes Site Support or Base Facility."
"One supervisor will monitor the system, and other users might need to monitor the running 
of observing programs, locally or remotely."
"As a conclusion, the Gemini 8m Telescopes control software shall allow simultaneous operation 
of up to six active control nodes and up to two more monitoring nodes (one local and one remote) without 
appreciable degradation of performance."
"In practice the operation and facilities foreseen so far for the Gemini 8m Telescopes will limit 
this number to a maximum in the order of three active nodes, but the Gemini 8m Telescopes 
computers and software shall be capable of coping with the load of 10 active nodes, should the 
case arise"
"This section is intentionally kept at the level of performance criteria rather than 
response times (found in Section 2.11.2 on page 2- 22)."
"There must be automatic procedures to implement startup and shutdown of the 
telescope and instruments."
"Reconﬁguration procedures must exist, to change the observing environment."
"Operations staff have privileges to change the environment, meaning selecting a suitable 
combination of instrumentsThe operational software should know which subsystems are 
installed and operational at any given time."
"The user interface deﬁnes the way users see the Gemini 8m 
Telescopes system."
"Given the large number of instruments, there can be many different 
stations which are active at the same time."
"It is essential for operational and maintenance 
reasons that, in spite of the obvious differences of the setups and commands available, the 
same philosophy is applied throughout."
"This calls for a homogeneous user interface, which can be achieved only by applying the same 
user interface tools to the whole project, providing the Gemini 8m Telescopes user 
interface's ‘look and feel’."
"Given the 
requirement to be able to access the Gemini 8m Telescopes from several points, the user 
interface should rather be seen as a package to be callable from a large number of stations, 
depending on where a user is."
"It should also be network transparent so that it does not matter 
where it is being run."
"The user interface tools shall be based on standards, deﬁned in Section 4.2.5 on page 4- 7, 
which will be portable across different computer hardware platforms (Portable User Interface 
Toolkit)."
"The intent of a portability requirement is to facilitate migrating existing and future 
Gemini systems to different hardware as the need arises."
"It is the current intent to limit the 
selection of computer hardware platforms to as few as is practical"
The deﬁnition of these terms is as follows:
main processors - these are the computers with which the user interacts
a standard set of interface cards to be used on all the subsystems and instruments
"It is also essential to avoid software duplication, and to simplify the Gemini 8m 
Telescopes software."
"Microprocessor software in particular tends to contain hardware speciﬁc 
software, though one should try to keep it as hardware independent as possible, isolating 
different software layers."
"The standard software must be adequate for the real-time requirements and must offer drivers 
to the standard electronics to be used on all the Gemini 8m Telescopes software subsystems 
and instruments."
"There is also software which, although it will be interfaced to the Gemini 8m Telescopes, 
is referred to as external."
"In order to make efﬁcient use of the telescope, to support different observing 
modes, and to support the versatility requirements, some form of on-line image (or pixel) 
quick-look analysis is required."
"“It shall be possible to monitor the quality (image quality, spectral resolution, 
signal to noise, etc.)"
of the astronomical data as it comes in.
"Advanced pipeline procedures might make this feasible, 
at least for observations of a standard nature.”"
"A prerequisite for this is that acquired data are 
made available as directly as possible in a common format, and that all additional data related
to an exposure and logging information are made available on-line at the same time."
"Quick-look should be usable within exposure sequences to provide results and feedback 
parameters to the control software in a programmed way, without the need for manual 
intervention."
"This document does not try to be speciﬁc about the requirements for Quick-look 
other than that it should be synchronous."
"remove instrument and observatory effects so the observer can make decisions 
about further observing actions)."
"EXTERNAL INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS
It should also be noted that some Gemini 8m Telescopes subsystems, such as adaptive optics, 
may require their own special on-line pixel processing software, which is better deﬁned in the 
requirements for those subsystems."
"The same situation might also occur with other instruments, where speciﬁc observer support 
software has to be foreseen for on-line use."
"In all these cases the speciﬁc on-line (quick-look) software development shall be seen as a 
subset of the development for the off-line data reduction system, to avoid as far as possible 
duplication of development effort."
"As comparisons with previous data might be of great value and affect the actual observing 
program, on-line interactive access to the data archiving system should exist, so that access 
to this database is possible for Gemini 8m Telescopes users."
"; the amount 
of a speciﬁc exposure available; header only, averaged exposure, complete raw data set; and the 
time frame within which such data will be made available; same night, weekly, after proprietary 
period; will be established by the Gemini Archiving Requirements."
"Computer access to star catalogues is also required, so that an automatic selection of candidate 
guide and standard stars can be made."
"The Gemini 8m Telescopes software must be able to interface with all commercial 
software packages available on the Gemini 8m Telescopes and integrated into the 
Gemini 8m Telescopes operation."
"A relevant example of such a package is a general database management system (DBMS), where 
operational information such as schedules, logs, problem reports and maintenance information 
related to various pieces of equipment should be kept.Being in itself a distributed telescope 
system and having a large number of instruments, the Gemini 8m Telescopes 
system has internal communication needs"
"Being in itself a distributed telescope system and having a large number of 
instruments, the Gemini 8m Telescopes system has internal communication needs."
"This LAN shall be supplemented with a Local Time Bus, for distribution of absolute and 
relative time signals, and both a digital reﬂective memory bus and an analog event-based bus, 
for distribution of signals with requirements not satisﬁed by a LAN."
"This layer could be considered as internal to a given subsystem 
or instrument, but as more than one subsystem might need it, one should aim for a unique 
solution at the hardware and software level."
"No distinction is made here between WAN and point to point links as there 
shall be no difference in the software between the two cases."
"However the system 
architecture will be designed so as to minimize the communication load placed on peer
 and higher level networks."
"The reason for repeating them here is to have a complete 
view of the required network functionality.To eliminate conceptual access problems, while 
coping with different bandwidths, LAN and WAN interfaces shall be homogeneous and shall 
be based on standards which allow migration on different media, should they become required 
during the Gemini 8m Telescopes project life."
"For maintenance reasons and hardware independence, a clear hierarchical model must be 
implemented, supporting separation of logical and physical layers, e.g."
It is recognized that this hierarchy may need to be violated for (in general) performance reasons.
"Network redundancy should also be considered in the design phase as a way to increase 
reliability and security, in particular for control information."
"Peer-to-peer connectivity should only be used to overcome a demonstrated 
performance problem."
"It is envisaged that observing astronomers who have travelled to the Gemini 
8m Telescopes site will make use of the Gemini 8m Telescopes control room facilities."
"This will allow centralized support and coordination of their operations, providing both 
operations support for individual instruments and supervision for all of them."
"To allow coordination both locally
 at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site between the various users and with remote users, the 
software shall support access to the system from any user station."
"It will then be an operational
 decision, implying privileges and priorities for the various categories of users, and deﬁnition 
of what a given user can actually do."
"Although some of these constraints may appear redundant 
the project recognizes that:"
"during the next 5 to 10 years new hardware will be available with features and costs 
that could beneﬁt the project"
"the cost of maintaining an existing hardware standard, even if available, may 
exceed the costs of adopting a new hardware standard"
"These constraints recognize that the majority of the expense in changing
 hardware standards is the cost of the software."
"Computers used at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site, particularly in the test phase
 when they are outside the control room and near the subsystem under test, shall be checked 
against altitude and humidity speciﬁcations for the Gemini 8m Telescopes site 
(see also [EDS] in Section 1.3)."
"Computer hardware must be able to run the Gemini 8m Telescopes software
 environment (operating systems, Gemini 8m Telescopes software) and provide compatibility 
in data format (identical internal data representation)."
".Local processing power must be such that telescope and instrument control
 does not represent a signiﬁcant overhead in the whole process of executing an observing
 program (the overhead, if any, should be limited by the time it takes
 for physical devices to act)"
"The choice of a scalable hardware architecture with computers at various 
performance levels should solve the problem of adequate on-line data 
assessment, as the amount of this activity is very variable and dependent upon the
 kind of detector and method used."
".Due to the limited bandwidths which may be available remotely, there will be
 constraints on the functionality of remote operations and access."
"Depending on funding, it is probably reasonable here to make a minimum 
and a desirable speciﬁcation."
"It should be a goal to support remote 
observing from the Gemini 8m Telescopes base facilities."
"Some of the general requirements which have a direct effect on the software 
are here explicitly transformed into software constraints."
Individual instruments must be able to run fully independently.
"Telescope software at the two telescopes must be maintained to be identical
 in the upper layers (even if hardware should differ)."
"There must be easy procedures to reconﬁgure the system when subsystems 
are modiﬁed or removed."
"Commercial and public domain packages should 
be used whenever possible."
Existing software packages should be reused wherever possible.
Existing software expertise should be consulted whenever possible.
"All software which does not directly control speciﬁc hardware must be written 
as machine independent, portable code."
"Even for microprocessor software, the 
software should be hardware independent, to allow a later choice
 of the target microprocessors."
"To allow for expansion and maintenance, Gemini 8m Telescopes standards
 must be deﬁned for the on-line software and the development environment."
"That is, the version control system
 must be available to recover/restore versions at all times."
".Table-driven software should be used whenever possible, to avoid unnecessary 
compilations."
"Whether the software is table driven, message driven, or a combination of 
both is a function of the individual work packages and deﬁned in the appropriate work
 package description."
"Changing system constants, such as arcseconds/bit for an encoder,
 shall not require recompiling but will be updated as part of system startup, and, for some 
constants, will be modiﬁable during operation."
"System status parameters will be maintained 
to an extent that will allow restarting the system and regaining the previous state."
"Strict checking should be applied on this to preserve maintainability and reconﬁguration of
the system."
"I think you should include Rick’s information about complexity criteria here,
 so show that we are aiming to achieve as simple as system as we can which meets the
 requirements."
"The goals 
and issues to be addressed by this plan and the elements of the plan are detailed below."
"Reliability is deﬁned as “The duration or probability of failure-free performance 
under state conditions” or “The probability that an item can perform its intended function for 
a speciﬁed interval under stated conditions”."
"The [GSR] sets as a requirement 2% and a goal 1% 
for total system (mechanical, electrical, and software) downtime due to failures - this translates 
to a maximum of 15 minutes per night or 1 night per month of downtime."
"To guarantee maximum availability of the control system, retry procedures must be embodied 
in the software in case of error or failure (e.g."
"time-out, hardware failure) to achieve recovery 
on-line whenever possible."
"Should recovery also fail, the error or failure has to be reported in a clear form (to identify the 
cause of the problem) and the system shall put itself into a safe state, whenever a safety aspect 
might be involved."
"To avoid unnecessary downtime, it must be possible for the system to reconﬁgure itself in order 
to continue observing, in a different mode if required, given the failure of a single non-critical 
subsystem.To increase software robustness, range checking and validity checking shall be 
supported before execution of any input command."
"This must be possible ahead of time, 
preparing observing sequences for automatic observations and simulating observations to 
estimate results."
"It must be possible to apply continuous monitoring to
all subsystems on request, both when in operation and when idle, to check their operational 
status."
"A measure of fault rates should be done during commissioning to establish baseline rates 
for system reliability monitoring."
There are to be recovery procedures to restart after error failure.
"The system should be constantly monitoring active subsystems to be sure they are operating 
correctly before sending command to each subsystem."
"The goal for recover and/or reconﬁguration is 5 minutes from onset of the error condition to 
observing again."
The method of upgrading the system to add capabilities and performance.
"Areas where upgrades are anticipated should be identiﬁed with an estimate of the
required effort and resources."
"These issues will be addressed in the context of the mountain 
environment where the system will be operating."
"Maintenance of commercial software (Solaris, VxWorks) used by this work 
package is the responsibility of the WPR and the maintenance costs are not covered by
the work package budget."
"All subsystem software is to include modules to aid in the maintenance and testing of 
the subsystem."
"For example, each subsystem is to include a simulator that provides a 
reference behavior for that subsystem."
The following self-check levels are to be supplied with sub-system software:
"Monitor level
Each subsystem should have a background task running whenever 
that subsystem is operational, performing such tasks as checking power supply levels, 
temperatures, performance, correct responses to commands."
"The OCS is to be notiﬁed 
of any detected problems."
"Problems 
are to be automatically reported to the OCS via the deﬁned interface."
The levels at which maintenance may be performed are:
The prime objectives are to minimize:
"The requirements must be achievable and stated 
in such a way that veriﬁcation is permitted."
Mean Time to Repair for each maintenance level
Maximum Time to Repair for each maintenance level
All necessary safety approvals will be obtained before devices will be accepted.
"Safety:
Freedom from those conditions that can cause death, injury,
 occupational illness, or damage to or loss of equipment or property"
"Hazard:
Something that could cause death, injury, illness, or damage/loss."
"The Gemini system must be self-monitoring to invoke safety monitoring 
to prevent risk to people or damage to equipment."
"The software should be able to quickly 
bring the Gemini system to a safe state upon notiﬁcation of such danger."
"Subsystems must 
be able to detect such danger and report it appropriately."
"In the event that the risk persists, 
subsystems must be able to move themselves into safe states to protect people and equipment 
(i.e."
"Safety protection must be applied whenever there is the risk that the actions of the control 
software could endanger people or cause damage to any Gemini 8m Telescopes subsystem, 
for example, by driving beyond limits or by overexposing detectors."
"This protection, where 
implemented, must be independent of the software."
The order in which these systems will work is as follows:
"software limits - the software will not allow unsafe actions; the command 
will be rejected"
"soft limit switches - the software will detect unsafe areas and halt; the software will 
allow movement off of soft limits"
software watch dogs - the software will halt if its watch dog has not been reset
hardware watch dogs - the system will halt if its watch dog has not been reset
"hard limit switches - these switches will remove power from actuator when beyond 
soft limits; 
the software/electrical systems will allow movement off of hard limits"
"hardware interlocks - these will prevent both software and hardware from action - 
there 
will be no bypass of these systems"
"In general hard stops 
will use dampers to avoid damage to equiment."
"The Gemini 8m Telescopes software shall be able to bring the Gemini 8m 
Telescopes system quickly to a safe state upon detection of danger."
"Security must be provided in order to both prevent accidental mix-up of commands from 
different users on different parts of the system and to prevent intrusion from the wide area 
network into the Gemini 8m Telescopes."
"In particular, the astronomical database must be 
protected from intrusion, whether the purpose is to access private data or to be destructive."
"It is acceptable, and may well prove to be the best solution, to provide intrusion security by 
a well designed network gateway acting as a ﬁrewall."
"A system that is operating in Engineering/Maintenance mode must ignore directives from 
other systems, though status information should still be provided for use by other systems."
The interlock philosophy is as follows:
"All hazards capable of causing death and/or loss of irreplacable equipment shall be 
passively interlocked."
"All hazards capable of causing injury and/or severe damage to equipment shall be 
actively 
interlocked (severe damage implies that repairs are not repairable at the depot level"
use interlocks and other protective devices when hazards cannot be eliminated
provide distinctive markings and warnings to protect people
"This plan will address 
all areas 
of testing from design, acceptance, commissioning through to hand-over."
"Testability:
A design characteristic which allows the status of a unit to be conﬁdently 
determined in a timely fashion."
"Built-in-test:
An integral capability of the mission equipment which provides an 
onboard, automated test capability to detect, diagnose, or isolate system failures."
"The interpretation of this table is that we should discover the failure of a 
subsystem 90% of the time before the failure impacts observing."
"Since the Gemini software will be developed in stages over a period of years, 
and since computer technology is expected to evolve rapidly over this same period, 
the software is to be designed to be easily extended and upgraded with modiﬁcations 
to non-changing components."
"The software itself, its installation process, and its 
documentation must be developed with this expandability in mind, using general industry 
standards."
"All software is to be developed using typical modularization and 
standardization techniques."
"Module selection should be done in logical fashion to minimize 
the size of the interfaces between modules."
"the functionality of a subsystem should correspond 
to that which belongs to that subsystem and only to that, so that software for different 
subsystems can be installed and maintained independently 
of all the rest.This is needed in particular for multi-instrument operation, for example, as 
instruments share the same subsystems on the telescope."
"At the same time, the possibility must exist to acquire information about other parts of the 
system (for example, telescope coordinates) (as mentioned in the control ﬂow requirements 
in Section 3.1.1)."
It also important that there are no undesired interactions between subsystems.
"However, the ability to reconﬁgure the software if one actuator fails is desirable."
"Data redundancy is also a requirement, to prevent a single failure from causing the loss 
of collected data."
"The goal is to minimize the effects of single-point errors throughout 
the system."
"As much as possible, the system is to take advantage of parallel operation 
to improve efﬁciency."
"The Telescope Control System should be capable of detecting 
and invoking parallel operation as it is responsible for control of all of the telescope 
and enclosure subsystems."
"The Gemini 8m Telescopes software has to be developed according to a 
structured and formally deﬁned development model."
make the development process visible (for quality and maintenance reasons)
"This has to be deﬁned in [SMP] and [SCP] (see Applicable Documents, Section 1.3),
 which will cover:"
"The development environment for the Gemini 8m Telescopes software 
consists of the computer hardware and system software 
(operating system, languages and tools) chosen optimally to support the development 
model presented in the previous section on life-cycle aspects."
"The choice of such an environment has to be deﬁned, together with the choice of all the 
Gemini 8m Telescopes standards, but excluding the target computer hardware, 
in Section 4.2.5 on page 4- 7."
Portability of software (target hardware independence)
"Test procedure methods have to be deﬁned in the Software Test Plan (STP), 
while test plans shall be written for all individual software packages and modules comprising 
the Gemini 8m Telescopes software."
"Apart from the component and integration test procedures, a formal release system 
should exist at package and module level, which should be checkable on-line by the 
operational procedures for consistency."
"Every system must thus be able to supply its 
current version upon request."
"All software is to be developed using typical modularization and standardization
techniques."
"Module 
selection should be done in logical fashion to minimize the size of the interfaces between 
modules."
"The on-line databases can be considered part of this interface, but are only
accessible Reliability and availability A measure of fault rates should be done during 
commissioning to establish baseline rates for system reliability monitoring."
There are to be recovery procedures to restart after error failure.
"During science planning, there should be validity and feasibility checks to
 help ensure effective and efﬁcient use of the telescope."
"Where appropriate, these checks 
should also  be performed during operation."
"The system should be constantly monitoring 
active subsystems to be sure they are operating correctly before sending commands to each 
subsystem."
"All telescope and instrument parameters are kept in an on line database to 
permit easy implementation of table-driven  applications."
".All telescope, instrument, and detector control information is to be available 
at any operation level."
Access times to the database are to be in the range of 2-3 msec per access.
"Asynchronous writes are to be supported, allowing for concurrent operation."
There is to be a consistent and logical (i.e.
"The internal (within the IOC) implementation of this  database is to be based 
on EPICS."
"A fundamental criteria of Gemini telescope operation is that it support a 
full implementation of remote operations."
"This  includes remote observing, remote control
 of telescope, enclosure, and instruments, multipoint monitoring, remote monitoring, remote 
access for testing, development, diagnostics, and maintenance, It is expected that all 
operational capability found in on site operations is extended to remote operations, with 
some degradation in performance resulting from WAN bandwidth considerations."
"This means 
the video data signals must be encoded digitally and transferred via the WAN to remote sites."
"There must be some form of security to control access to  system features, possibly 
restricting some operations to speciﬁc remote sites (e.g."
"Final storage locations for the data types is presented here, along with
 a description of the different databases  that are available."
"There is also a central repository maintained by the OCS that holds these
 databases for down-loading to the IOCs."
"All additional data that is not required on line (conﬁguration information, detailed
 documentation, operation logs, etc.)"
Input data are all data that are predeﬁned at operation  start.
"Observing commands (whether entered interactively or via the Sequencer) 
are input data that provide information on the
 course of operation and trigger events."
"Replies to commands, including status information, updates to parameters, 
video and astronomical information are considered data outputs."
"Operational information, such as logging
 messages, alarms, and errors are special forms of output data, since they are  made
 available for later inspection and debugging."
"One criteria is that sufﬁcient information be recorded during an observation
 to recreate the sequence of events that  occurred during the observation."
"This requires
 that all  input and output data be logged appropriately."
"Is is possible to enter interactive operation 
from automatic operation to handle exceptional conditions.This is the normal mode 
of operation at maintenance and test levels."
"Overall performance of the Gemini telescope is deﬁned as 
the percentage of viewable time during which exposures have been taken 
(i.e."
"To improve this performance, all possible concurrencies in system 
operation should be used."
"Best use of concurrency occurs 
when using the Sequencer."
"There are start-up and shut-down 
procedures that must exist at many different levels:"
"Cold start-up, starting the system from scratch (including time to download all software) 
should take about 5 minutes."
"This does not include time to start-up the telescope 
or instruments."
"Warm start-up, starting from scratch but also excluding software download time 
should take about 1 minute."
"Instrument start-up, measured from end of telescope start-up, 
should take 2 minutes or less.There must be a way to shut down all subsystems 
(hardware and software)."
"All start-ups and shut-downs are to be automatically 
logged with time stamps, to allow for statistics on system availability."
"System logging information should include all important events, properly 
timestamped and indexed."
"The goal is to be able to recreate the steps in a observation 
from the system logs."
"It must be possible to log engineering data at up to 200 Hz rates for short 
periods of time."
"Fatal
 Fatal errors occur if there is no acceptable recovery procedure that will 
allow operation to proceed."
"Serious
Under serious errors, the system does not need to move off-line, but 
the current operation cannot be completed."
Warning All other unexpected conditions result in warnings that are properly logged.
"Recovery
 In addition to start-up procedures, there must be well-deﬁned recovery 
procedures for any subsystem that has become inoperative."
"These retries should occur automatically in the command handling to avoid 
unnecessary error conditions."
"Performance The performance of error-mode recovery is speciﬁc to the subsystem 
and is deﬁned in the Functional speciﬁcation for that subsystem."
"However, in the case of an instrument failure, it may be 
possible to continue operation by rescheduling to use observations 
that do not require that particular instrument"
"For serious errors, it may be possible to continue operation with degraded 
performance."
"For example, failure of automatic tracking may require manual tracking; 
other errors may result in operation with a different instrument"
"The system should monitor the rate of warning messages since an increase 
might indicate that some tuning or maintenance is appropriate."
"All Gemini supported software is to be developed using a  
formally deﬁned model."
"Functional analysis is done using a CASE tool suitable for use with 
Ward/Mellor techniques, such as TSEE, by Westmount Technologies."
"The design is to use the techniques and diagrams introduced by  Ward and Mellor and 
reviewed by the Gemini staff."
"Detailed design and development standards are not speciﬁed,  but expected to conform 
to system goals and established  practice."
"The upper levels (User-interface and OCS) are assumed to not require a 
real-time operating environment."
"However, the operating environment at these levels 
is expected to provide sufﬁcient performance for both human interaction and communications."
"The development operating system is UNIX System V, Release 4, using only POSIX
 compliant calls to the operating system."
"Any special needs that cannot be acceptably met by the available operating 
system calls are to be discussed with the GPO on a case-by-case basis."
"Some packages (such as GUI interfaces and database interfaces) have higher
 portability requirements that may require the speciﬁcation 
of higher level interfaces to the OS."
"The GUI systems are to use X-windows, version 11, release 5 (X11R5) 
or release 6 (X11R6)."
"The communication interface between the IOCs and
 Unix workstations is to be IMP."
"It is assumed that all IOC software is to be developed on Unix workstations 
in a windowed development environment."
"The cross-compiler to be used for IOC software development is one speciﬁed 
by the Gemini Project."
It is the GNU cc compiler as furnished with VxWorks.
"IOC software development is to be done using a common development environment,
 as speciﬁed in  the Software Programming Standards (SPS)"
"There is likely to be software below the IOC
level, but it should not require downloading, except possibly for upgrades, typically being
placed into ROM or FLASH memory."
"Any access to this embedded software while it is 
connected to the system is strictly through software in the IOC."
"Although this software is not considered
part of the Gemini software, it is obviously an advantage (for maintenance purposes) to 
have it conform to the requirements of Gemini software."
".The software interface between workstation and IOC is to use DRAMA’s IMP
 protocol for all control communication, using SDS as the command structure.."
".Communications between real-time components is to based on the EPICS 
Channel Access protocol."
"However, it will be possible to connect such software into the
 Gemini system if interface routines are developed for connecting to the Gemini system."
"Packages that might be used for off-line data reduction include 
ADAM, IRAF, Midas, IDL and Khoros."
"The catalogs available on the Gemini system are described in
 TBD, as are software access  requirements."
"Conﬁguration, logging, maintenance schedules, and subsystem documentation 
are to be kept in the commercial relational database."
"Installed systems
 are to be chosen later, based on available technology and experiences with the development 
systems."
"Workstations must match speciﬁed software standards and present a well-designed
 development environment, including cross-support for 
VxWorks development, if needed."
".Workstations are expected to be state-of-the-art systems 
(CPU, communications support) in a scaleable family."
".It is assumed that workstations support Ethernet IEEE-802.3 and FDDI
 interfaces for communications."
SCSI-interface peripherals are to be available.
".Reliability, manufacturer support, and upgrade capability of the development 
systems will be considered when selecting the ﬁnal target systems."
"Where Gemini is providing the computer equipment as part of a 
contractual agreement, the developmental workstations are to be SUN SPARC-10 
(model 41) or SPARC Classic with 64MB of dynamic memory."
"Internal Gemini software development is done in a multi-platform 
environment, enabling ﬁnal selection of target machines to be made based on 
experiences with development equipment."
Workstations are to have at least 2GB of disk.
"DDS DAT cartridges are to be available for data  acquisition on 
development systems, backups, and possibly for software transport 
(Internet is the preferred means of transport)."
"Any compression on a transport medium is to be done using a standard 
commonly available algorithm and archives are to be in tar format"
"Where Gemini is providing the IOC CPU as part of a contractual agreement, 
the development systems are to be
Motorola MVME-167B (68040@33MHz) with at least 16MB of dynamic memory."
"The target IOC computer cards are not to be established until as late 
as possible, to take advantage of technology advances while staying compatible 
with the development systems."
"All accesses to the control electronics hardware will be  through VME IOC's, 
using the EPICS software."
"There are places in the Gemini system where software exists below the IOC 
level that is interfaced to IOC software."
"The use of this software is to be explained and discussed on a 
case-by-case basis."
"In cases where there is a distributed network of target  microprocessors involved at this 
level, it is appropriate to provide a standard sub-network."
"This type of Fieldbus is to be 
implemented using an ALAN/BRADLEY bus, ProﬁBus, or other approved Fieldbus."
"In cases where there is a distributed set of commercial equipment to be controlled the 
recommended method is to use an ALAN/BRADLEY system to control the equipment manually 
and interface to it using RS-422 or similar connection to an IOC."
"All communication hardware must meet the data ﬂow requirements 
and software protocols deﬁned in this document."
"It is entirely appropriate that changes 
will be  made to take advantages of changes to that technology."
The control LAN is based on Ethernet IEEE 802.3.
"A solution meeting the performance requirements of the ﬁnal system is to be
 decided later."
The backbone LAN cannot be Ethernet because of bandwidth requirements.
"Also shown are cabling requirements 
to the base facility."
"Wherever possible, Gemini software is to take advantage of existing software."
"However, all existing software is to be evaluated in terms of the speciﬁcations given here."
This helps reduce life-cycle costs and maintenance efforts.
"Within the EPICS community there is understood to be an informal distinction between 
two classes of developers, labeled ‘Internals’ and ‘Applications’."
"Although these deﬁnitions
 are nowhere written down, this understanding serves as the basis for many 
discussions with the community and for the nature of training classes."
"Note: The bulk of this section is taken from the EPICS document
 ‘EPICS Overview’."
"EPICS consists of a set of hardware and software components 
from which a control system can be created."
"This is a UNIX based workstation which can run
 various EPICS tools."
"This is VME/VXI based chassis containing a Motorola 68xxx processor, 
various I/O modules, and VME modules that provide access to other
 I/O buses such as GPIB."
"This is the communication network which allows the   IOCs and OPIs
 to communicate."
"EPICS provides a software component, Channel Access, which
 provides network transparent communication between a Channel Access client
 and an arbitrary number of Channel Access servers."
"The ﬁrst ﬁeld of every database record holds the record name, which
 must be unique across all IOCs attached to the same TCP/IP subnet."
A number of data structures are provided so that the database can be accessed efﬁciently.
"Most software components, because they access the database via database access
 routines, do not need to be aware of these structures."
"Databases Access
With the exception of record and device support, all access to the 
database is via the channel or database access routines."
"Databases Scanning
Database scanning is the mechanism for deciding when to process 
a record."
"Four types of scanning are possible: Periodic, Event, I/O Event, and Passive."
Periodic:    A request can be made to process a record periodically.
"The actual subroutine call is: 
post_event(event_num) I/O Event:    The I/O event scanning system processes
 records based on external interrupts."
"An IOC device driver interrupt routine must 
be available to accept the external interrupts."
"Record Support, Device Support, and Device Drivers
In order to remove record speciﬁc knowledge from database access, 
each record type has an associated record support module."
"If the method of accessing hardware is complicated,
 a device driver can be provided to shield the device support modules."
"The IOC software is designed so that the database access layer knows nothing 
about the record support layer other than how to call it."
"The record support layer in 
turn knows nothing about it’s device support layer other than how to call it."
"Similarly
 the only thing a device support layer knows about it’s associated driver is how to call it."
"This design allows a particular installation and even a particular IOC within an installation
 to choose the set of record types, device types, and drivers it wishes to use."
"It is this routine that is called by the database
 scanners."
"Databases Monitors
The routines described in this section provide a callback mechanism
 for database value changes."
"This allows the caller to be notiﬁed when database
 values change without constantly polling the database."
"A mask can be set to specify
 value changes, alarm state changes, and/or archive changes."
"Because they are of interest only to channel access, the monitor routines
 will not be described."
"Each IOC provides a channel access server which 
is willing to establish communication with an arbitrary number of clients."
"It should be noted that channel access
 does not provide access to database records as records."
"This allows new record types to be addedwithout impacting 
any software that accesses the database via channel access."
"A channel access
 client can communicate with multiple IOCs having differing 
sets of record types."
they are used to monitor and control IOCs.
"DM Display Manager
This tool reads one or more display list ﬁles created by EDD, establishes 
communication with all necessary IOCs, establishes monitors on process variables, accepts
 operator control requests, and updates the display to reﬂect all changes."
"AR Archive
This is a general purpose tool to acquire and save
 data from IOCs."
"Sequencer
A tool which runs in an IOC or OPI and emulates 
a ﬁnite state machine."
"Other OPI CA clients
It is possible to interface preexisting software systems to the channel 
access library."
"This has been done for several commercial packages including 
IDL/ PvWave, Mathematica, and WINGZ to allow access and manipulation of EPICS
process variables by these applications."
"DCT Databases Configuration Tool
This tool is used to create a run time database for an IOC"
"CAPFAST and GDCT Graphical Databases Configuration Tools
These tools are used to create a run time database for an IOC"
"EDD Display Editor
This tool is used to create a display list ﬁle for the Display Manager."
"SNC State Notation Compiler
It generates a C program that represents the states for the IOC
 or OPI Sequencer tool."
"Build Tools
Tools are available to create the various database components from 
ASCII deﬁnition ﬁles."
"the components of EPICS without which EPICS would
not function, are:"
"Of course any application 
developer would be crazy to ignore tools such as MEDM (or EDD/DM)."
"Most OPI tools do not, however, have to be used."
"Each of the Gemini Controls work packages will be involved with some 
aspect of EPICS development ranging from creation of new device drivers to database 
creation and the design of new CA clients.The details of the EPICS work required can be 
broken down into several broad categories which reﬂect the nature of the various work 
packages."
"Other OPI CA Clients
The OCS may need a CA client that implements the OCS Attribute/Value protocol."
The DHS may need a CA client that gathers logging information.
"Files associated with OPI Channel Access Tools
These would include MEDM .adl display deﬁnition ﬁles, PvWave/IDL scripts, 
AR request ﬁles, ALH alarm conﬁguration ﬁles, 
and the like."
"For the purposes of work performed for the Gemini 8-m Telescopes 
Project the following deﬁnitions will be used to differentiate 
between the two ﬂavors of EPICS development work:"
"The latter two items would be covered 
under Advanced Application Development and a case can probably be made 
that they constitute a category unto themselves which should be labeled 
something like ‘Internals - Tools’"
"These are all topics that would be covered in an EPICS Basics, Building 
and Using Applications course."
The following sections list those that would be commonly used.
"The experience of the High Energy Physics community is that only a 
core group of Internals developers is required for maintenance and enhancement of 
EPICS IOC software and of the standard development and CA client tool set."
"Many sites contribute custom CA client tools as this generally involves C or 
C++ programming under a UNIX O/S to interface to the standard CA library."
"Although there is presently a large amount of activity in the enhancement of 
EPICS Internals software especially in the ﬁelds of non-IOC core software, this is 
an order of magnitude less than the amount of Applications work under way at over 
20 distinct programs."
"Another large group of predominately Applications developers that are 
starting work are the Collaborative Access Teams (CATS) at 
Argonne’s Advanced Photon Source (APS).The APS is a facility to produce high brilliance 
X-rays for a variety of experiments and includes 36 experimental halls with 2 lines each."
"Because the experimental areas must be coordinated with the main facility control 
system and since 25% of the beamtime must be made available to independent investigators 
it was strongly recommended that EPICS be used as the toolkit for all CATS development 
work."
"Typically, each CAT has 1 or 2 developers, and the major focus is not on the IOC software 
although some new records, like the Multichannel Analyser, have been created, but rather 
on the OPI CA client applications."
"Heavy use is being made of both Tcl/TK and IDL to 
support high-level sequencing and data reduction."
"This is similar to the Gemini architecture 
as the bulk of the control system intelligence is contained within OPI CA client tasks."
"Different science programs in use at each CAT which have complex associated data 
acquisition and reduction routines."
"It is 
anticipated that all other IOC-related work packages will be performing exclusively 
Applications work."
"In the advent of future work packages requiring Internals work it is planned the RGO 
SIC development staff will be made available."
"This mechanism requires that some (unknown to the source) target subsystem 
has been attached to the channel as the target."
"It is possible that the channel is 
'intelligent', in the sense that data may be converted from one form to another 
during transmission."
"The A&G might be transmitting Zernickes to the PMCS, which is receiving Shack-
Hartmann data."
"It is possible that a channel have multiple sources, multiple targets, or both!"
"Finally, 
a channel might use a separate physical route, to prevent large data transmissions (say) 
from interfering with the 'normal' command streams."
"For example, the OCS might broadcast a RunTest 
command, causing all subsystems to perform self-testing."
"As another example, a 
critical system failure might cause a ShutDown command 
to be broadcast."
"This section presents the “generic” commands that all Gemini systems 
must respond to."
"There are also “Control Commands” common to all Gemini systems 
to provide speciﬁc functionality during observing."
"The following commands are “status” queries used to obtain information 
about the state of the subsystem."
"CONFIGURING
 the system is in the process of conﬁguring (Steven)."
"CONFIGURED
the subsystem is conﬁgured, but not yet initialized"
"RUNNING
the subsystem is running at observing level"
"DISABLE
 the subsystem is functional, but has been commanded to 
ignore control commands"
"READY
the subsystem is fully operational, but currently idle."
"BUSY_ON command
 the subsystem is working, and currently processing the indicated 
command."
A GetStatus command can be used to determine the current status.
"and, if requested, 
the detailed results of any self-tests."
"SetStatus
The target subsystem is to enter the state associated with the speciﬁed
 status argument."
"For example, SetStatus SIMULATION causes the targeted subsystem(s)
 to enter simulation mode."
Setting the status to SHUTDOWN disables a subsystem.
"It is important that care be taken to avoid conﬁguration values
that would result in motion, etc."
"This command can operate with the GetConﬁguration 
command given above to provide 'sequencing points' for 
subsystem restarts or roll backs."
"OK
 the subsystem has detected no problems, it is 
running within speciﬁcations"
"BAD
the subsystem has detected problems that prevent its 
successful operation"
"the subsystem has detected a problem that may prevent it from operating 
to full speciﬁcation, but does not prevent it from functioning at this time"
"SetLogging
 Logging by the indicated subsystem is set to
 occur at the speciﬁed level."
"Instances of this communication is via routes, 
which may be direct channels, intelligent channels, or broadcasts."
"Communication via a route is typically asynchronous, with commands
available to establish synchronization as needed."
"The command includes sufﬁcient information on the route to permit the IOC to 
communicate through the route."
"CloseRoute
The route is to be reinitialized."
"All receivers 
on the route are to respond with an identiﬁcation."
"AwaitItem
The module sending this command is blocked until information is 
received via the indicated route, or a timeout occurs."
"SetCallback
A callback is established to process data across the indicated route."
"Under the Gemini 
control system, it is expected that the majority of subsystem control is accomplished 
through these databases."
"LocateItem
If the IOC local database contains the requested item, it responds 
with an identiﬁcation sufﬁcient for establishing a route to that item."
"The IOC system continues to transmit data values until a StopStream command 
is received."
"Appropriate changes to that entry are to result in the indicated 
event being transmitted."
These commands are to permit appropriate time synchronizations.
"Some subsystems may need to obtain information from other systems 
within the Gemini control system."
"This access is accomplished using the same 
communication and database access commands as given above."
"Fields within the command are labelled and nesting is permitted using braces ({ , })."
"Details of the implementation are the province of the OCS work package 
developers, who are responsible for providing procedures for 
constructing/deconstructing/routing command strings."
"Work Package 
Descriptions include baseline command descriptions that 
need to be implemented for that speciﬁc work package."
"Only those conditions
expressed with the imperative ""shall"" are to be interp reted as
binding requirements for this SRS."
"It
does not provide a detailed definition of the exact systems that
will interface with THEMAS."
"The requirements specified in this document are to
be used as the basis for software design of the THEMAS system."
"The following section lists acronyms and abbreviations and their
meaning as used in this document:"
"This document is prepared in accordance with the American
National Standards Institute (ANSI) / Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Guide to Software Requirements
Specifications, ANSI/IEEE STD 830 -1984."
"Section 3.0 contains all the details
the Design Requirements team needs to create a design."
"This section of this SRS describes the general factors that
effect the THEMAS system and its requirements."
"This section does
not state specific requirements, it only makes these requirements
easier understood."
"The THEMAS system is a system that operates independent of any
other system, or any components of the heating and cooling system
to which it is attached."
"If assumptions or dependencies about the hardware
were made, they are stated in this section of the SRS."
"All four sections have an associated software
configuration item; all except the System Reports have an
associated hardware configuration item."
"After this process is
done, either temperature limit is exceeded or the temperature
change is requested."
"If the temperature change is requested,
then the determine heating/cooling mode process is activated and
makes a heating/cooling request."
"Some other processes that help
the monitor temperature function are: validate temperature,
change thermostat setting, generate alarm, and system
initialization."
"The function then processes
the status of all heating/cooling units and sends out either unit
unavailable or heating/cooling unit needed."
"The fun ction
generates either a unit unavailable event which goes into the
System Reports function or it generates a heating/cooling signal
to turn on/off the units."
"The Monitor Temperature and Initialize
System functions help the determine utilization to do its
processes."
"The processes that are associated with it
are: load heating/cooling unit definitions, turn off all
heating/cooling units, load th ermostat definitions, load
utilization parameters, set trigger values, set overtemperature
values, and establish valid temperature range."
"The outgoing
information that starts the entire THEMAS system is: clear all
heating/cooling signals, send thermostat definitions, send
utilization parameters, send trigger values, send overtemperature
values, and send valid temperature range."
"This function is a database that stores all the events
in the THEMAS system."
"This function is mainly for the use of
the supervisor of the THEMAS system to maintain an efficient
heating and cooling system."
"The only process that interacts with
the system reports function is the generate event data process."
"This system is intended to be used by people that maintain the
heating and cooling systems in a building."
"The displaying of
the current status of the system to the supervisor should not
contain excessive information which could confuse the supervisor."
"The system should provide information in the form of reports to
the supervisor so that the system can be run efficiently."
"The general constraints of the THEMAS system focus on the
functionality provided by the external devices connected to i t.
The thermostats shall only provide temperature values and
temperature settings."
"When a signal is sent to a
heating or cooling unit, no signal shall be available to allow
the THEMAS system to determine if the signal sent to the unit was
realized by the unit."
"The THEMAS system shall be designed to run on the Microsoft ®
Windows NT™ operating system."
"All the internal process
communications shall be designed to operate on this operating
system."
"It is assumed that the thermostat is capable of returning the
current temperature and the current desired temperature setting
to the THEMAS system."
"All data sent by the thermostat is in the correct format for the
THEMAS system to use."
"It is assumed that the heating/cooling unit is incapable of
returning its current off/on status to the THEMAS system."
"The
heating/cooling unit has no real time delay when sending these
statuses to the THEMAS system."
"This section is subdivided into ten main subsections: Initialize
Operational Parameters, Initialize System, Validate Temperature,
Monitor Temperature, Determine Utilization, Generate H/C Signal,
Generate Alarm Data, Generate Event Data, Change Thermostat
Setting, and Generate Reports."
"The THEMAS system shall control t he heating and cooling units
that are defined as part of the THEMAS system."
"The THEMAS system shall use the information contained in the
initialization data file to determine which heating and cooling
units are part of the THEMAS system."
"Ther e is one heating and
cooling unit that corresponds to one thermostat in each of four
quadrants on each of three floors of the office building."
"Each thermostat shall have a unique identifier by which that
thermostat is identified in the THEMAS system."
"Each quadrant of each floor shall have a thermostat which is to
be used to provide temperature data to the THEMAS system."
"The initialization file shall contain a unique identifier for each
thermostat that the system is to monitor."
"There shall be a maximum number of heating or cooling u nits that
can be on at any given time."
"The maximum number of heating or cooling units that can run
concurrently shall reside in an initialization file."
"The trigger value is used in combination with the current
temperature to determine when a heating or cooling unit shall be
turned on or off."
"The THEMAS system shall ensure the temperature reported by a
given thermostat shall not exceed a maximum deviation value of 3
degrees Fahrenheit."
"The THEMAS system shall only respond to temperatures that are
within a reasonable value."
"When the THEMAS system is initialized, it shall first turn off
all the heating and cooling units."
"Then , it shall check all the
thermostats and determine if any thermostat’s settings require a
heating or cooling unit to be turned on back on."
"If the settings
reflect a need for a heating or cooling unit to be turned o n, the
process shall issue a request to turn on the appropriate unit."
"The THEMAS system shall only respond to temperatures from the
thermostats that are within the specified valid range."
"A current temperature value that is received from an individual
thermostat shall be compared to the valid temperature range
values."
"If the current temperature value is strictly less than
the lower value of the valid temperature range or if the received
temperature value is strictly greater than the upper value of the
valid temperature range, then the THEMAS system shall identify
the current temperature value as an invalid temperature and shall
output an invalid temperature status."
"A temperature setting value that is received from an individual
thermostat shall be compared to the valid temperature range
values."
"If the temperature setting value is strictly less than
the lower value of the valid temperature range or if the
temperature setting value is strictly greater than the upper
value of the valid temperature range, then the THEMAS system
shall identify the temperature setting as an invalid temperature
and shall output an invalid temperature status."
"The THEMAS system shall determine wh en a reported temperature or
a changed temperature setting exceeds the limits set by the
overtemperature values."
"Temperatures that exceed the
overtemperature limits shall be reported as such."
"Temperatures
that do not exceed these limits shall be output for subsequent
processing."
"The THEMAS system shall compare the reported temperature value to
the temperature setting and detect when the temperature value
exceeds the specified limits."
"To clarify these conditions, the
following definitions will be used:
LO : Lower Overtemperature Value = TSET - OD
UO : Upper Overtemperature Value = TSET + OD
If T = LO or UO = T then the THEMAS system shall recognize this
condition as the temperature limit has been exceeded."
"In this
case this process shall output the condition of the temperature
limit having been exceeded."
"Temperature Trigger Exceeded
Temperature Limit Exceeded"
"When the current temperature value exceeds the current
temperature setting by a pre -defined amount, the THEMAS system
shall activate the appropriate heating or cooling unit.s"
"There are two conditions for each individual thermostat that
shall be tested for: 1) the thermostat’s settings are satisfied
and 2) the thermostat’s temperature indica tes it requires a
heating or cooling unit to be turned on."
"To clarify these
conditions, the following definitions will be used:
LT : Lower Trigger Value = TSET - TD
UT : Upper Trigger Value = TSET + TD
Condition 1: LT = T = UT
This condition indicates the thermostat’s current temperature
setting is satisfied."
"If this condition is true, then the module
shall output a request to turn off both the heating unit and the
cooling unit."
"If this condition is true, then this module shall
output a request to turn on the heating unit if LO = T LT or
the cooling unit if UT T = UO."
"The THEMAS system shall control each of the heating and cooling
units that are defined for the system."
"When a request to turn on a heating or cooling unit is received,
the system shall determine if the request can be honored."
"If the
maximum number of heating or cooling units is already running,
the request will be added to a LIFO queue."
"If the maximum number
of heating or cooling units is not running, this process will
generate a request to turn on the requested unit."
"When a request to turn off a heating or cooling unit is received,
this process shall check the queue of waiting heating and cooling
requests."
"If the queue is not empty, this process shall remove
one request from the LIFO queue and check the current state of
the thermostat for which the queued request was made."
"If that
thermostat still needs a heating o r cooling unit turned on, this
process shall submit a request to turn that unit on."
"When a request for a heating unit or cooling to be turned is
denied, an event shall be generated and the THEMAS system shall
record that event."
"This procedure shall realize the thermostat and heating or
cooling information and use this information to generate a
specific system event."
"This system event shall consist of a
description of the event type (a request denied event), a
designation of the thermostat that made the request, and a
designation of the heating or cooling unit that was not turned
on."
"The THEMAS system shall control the heating and cooling units
that are designated as part of the THEMAS system."
"When a request to turn on or off a heating or cooling unit is
made, this process shall generate the appropriate request to
carry out that request."
"This request shall include the
designation of the heating or cooling unit and a flag to indicate
whether that unit is to be turned on or off."
"This process shall recognize the values for the requested heating
or cooling unit and the ON or OFF status that is being requested."
"Since the interface to con trol the units has not been
defined, the part of this process that will issue the signal is
designated as TBD(to be determined)."
"In order to provide an operational history and statistical
reports, this process shall generate an event each time a change
is made to the status of a heating or cooling unit."
"This ev ent
shall contain the identification of the heating or cooling unit
whose status is being changed."
"There are two events that shall result in an alarm condition: 1)
an invalid temperature value is reported from a thermostat, or 2)
the reported temperature has exceeded the defined limits."
"This
process shall determine which alarm event is to be generated."
"When the THEMAS system detects a request for an alarm, this
process shall detect which of the two alarms are being requested."
"If the system detects an invalid temperature, this process shall
output a continuous series of alternating 500 Hz and 700 Hz beeps
on the supervisor’s computer."
"This series of beeps shall continue
until the supervisor manually resets the alarm through the
supervisor’s interface window."
"If the system detects a temperature limit has been exceeded, this
process shall output a continuous series of alternating 1000 Hz
and 1500 Hz beeps on the supervisor’s computer."
"This series of beeps shall
continue until the supervisor manually resets the alarm through
the supervisor’s interface window."
"Each time an alarm is requested, an alarm event shall be
recorded."
"This event shall be used to provide operational and
statistical reports about the system."
"For each event that is generated, the THEMAS system shall
identify each event and generate the appropriate event data."
"When an event occurs, the THEMAS system shall identify the event
type and format an appropriate event message."
"This information shall be recorded in a
Microsoft® Access® database that shall reside on the supervisor’s
computer."
"The THEMAS system shall provide the supervisor a mechanism to
change the temperature setting of any of the thermostats in the
system."
"The supervisor shall be able to select one of the thermostats and
select a value for the current temperature from a list of valid
temperatures."
"The THEMAS shall provide the ability for the supervisor to select
between two different types of reports: 1) the operational
history of the THEMAS system for the past twelve months and 2) a
statistical summary for any selected mont h."
"The supervisor’s interface to the THEMAS system shall provide a
mechanism to select between an operational history report or a
statistical summary report."
"Either report shall consist of an
ASCII file whose location and name shall be selectable by the
operator."
"If the operational history report is selected, the THEMAS system
shall select all the events from the event database, sort the
events by date and time, and create the ASCII report file."
"If the statistical report is selected, the THEMAS system shall
present the operator with a list of available months from which
to make a selection."
"For each thermometer, the ratio of the number of requests for
a heating and cooling unit that was granted to the number of
requests for a heating or cooling unit that was denied."

"Mirrored Databases:
Replication and maintenance of a database on a transaction basis 
for the purpose of rapid error or failure recovery as supported by the resident COTS 
RDBMS own system utilities and operating system."
"Object:

"There are several types/levels of RAID 
implementations, including: RAID 0 (known as disk striping), RAID 1 (known as 
disk shadowing), RAID 3 (in which data is distributed in small increments across 
all data disks and adds a parity value to a separate disk for recovery if any disk fails, 
RAID 4 (in which data is distributed in large chunks across all data disks and also has
a single parity disk."
"RAID 4 intended to overcome performance penalties of RAID 3 for 
small transfers."
"RAID 5 (in which parity over RAID 3 or RAID 4 implementations), 
and RAID 6 ( in which two parity disks in addition to data disks are used in an attempt 
to further improve performance)."

the lost data."
"Storage system vendors may provide additional enhancements to RAID level 
implementations to improve performance and reliability."
"Remote Data Access (RDA):

"Although XML is a relatively new 
technology, many developers are already using XML in operational COE 
systems and have already created tags and specifications, many of which 
may be inconsistent with tags used in other systems."
"To ensure interoperability, this registry provides a baseline 
set of tags developed through coordination and approval among the Community."
"The Registry allows a user to browse, search, and retrieve data that satisfy your 
requirements."
"The Registry has a substring search capability so that the user may 
easily find information resources that meet the criteria."
"The user may specify whether 
to search for the term within 
the name of the information resource or the definition or both."
"Developers are urged to review the baseline tags, adopt 
them where possible, and subscribe to future notifications about the tags."
"Document Type Definition (DTD)) or existing tags, you may submit your 
proposed tag to a Community of Interest (COI) and provide amplifying information 
for all to understand the semantics for its proper use."
"The COE Chief Engineer will approve a single Point of Contact (POC) 
for a COI to manage the tags within that COI."
"Tags and semantics will be analyzed to identify opportunities 
to consolidate tags towards a single or a minimal number of representations."
Review Tags in Registry and decide what additions/modifications to submit (if any)
Fill out one XML submission document to package multiple Tags
"If the term is well recognized outside its container term, designate 
it as an element."
"It would be expected that a submitter 
would identify them as attributes rather than elements."
"But if they were identified as 
attributes of the element ctry, then the additional baggage (other attributes) must be 
carried, or submitted as separate elements."
"We wish to limit the proliferation of tags, 
so we strongly urge folks to use XML_Attributes sparingly."
"Therefore, we urge submitters to include enough expressive terms so that COE developers 
would easily find the term they might consider ""natural"" in the definition and find the 
desirable tag for expressing that concept."
"Example: If the 
registered tag is ORG_ID, the description that includes references"

"This efficiency will have a maximum 
provision to expand this program beyond the pilot period, 
if the program requirements remain same."
"Bar-code – 
 the system will interface with the bar-code reader to interface all transaction 
details."
"The purpose of this document is to explain the flow and the requirement 
of Voucher Management System (VMU) required by Marie Stopes International Uganda
(MSIU) during the various meetings held between MSIU and Microcare from 28th of Nov 
2005 to 30th of Nov 2005."
"This document will help the system development team to understand the 
overall and detailed functions of every small entity in VMU and to design the system that 
will meet every requirement of the VMU program."
"This document will help the testing team 
to prepare the Test Cases and will help them to test every module in the system and overall 
testing of the system, so that the testing team will have confidence on the quality of this 
system."
"Past experiences with development aid showed, that financing inputs, 
e.g."
"Thus as a change of paradigm, the OBA concept finances agreed outputs 
with predefined quality rather than pre-defined inputs by selling vouchers for STD 
services at subsidised prices to patients."
"The major advantages of the OBA approach are, that it allows"
"To target resources to address selected health problems,"
"The principles of the voucher, the contents of the health care services, 
their required quality, the standards to be met by the providers and their infrastructure, 
as well as the measures for monitoring the 
quality have been defined in the PDS."
"The VMU establishes and runs a distribution system with the purpose
 to distribute the STD vouchers to the sexually active population for which the 
above-mentioned providers are in reach."
"STD treatment according to the National Treatment Algorithms for STD in Uganda (NTA), 
adapted for this voucher scheme (TA-OBA, treatment algorithms for STD treatment in the 
OBA scheme), 
is given to clients for free for the syndromes of"
"At the end of each month they hand in – respectively the claims processing 
agency (CPA) collects –"
"The VMU operates a monitoring system including follow-up with patients 
to monitor proper operation of the voucher scheme."
"The voucher management system VMS is designed to atomize 
the process of Voucher Management Unit (VMU) to minimize the manual process 
to maximize the quality of the project to understand the 
progress and timely out come of the project to take necessary steps by the MSIU 
Admin team to plan for the future and to increase the quality of the STD voucher 
service."
"The system will also control the existence of fraud in claims and will help
 the service provider to reach their payments in time without delay."
"The voucher management system is subdivided into following modules to 
make the system easy for understanding, developing, testing and to implement."
"Each of the above modules are again subdivided into subsystems, those details are explained in 
below sections in the document"
"This section of the document is going to explain the functionalities of 
the system, its subsystems and how it’s integrated and working together."
"During the system study, it was understood that the first pilot period, twenty 
thousand vouchers will be sold, but the VMU-system has the provision to upgrade to meet 
the additional market and projects needs."
"First visit is called as Consultation and if the patient is not cured then they can go 
for first follow 
up and second follow up,"
"If the patient is not cured then the doctor will refer the patient to some other 
Hospitals the hospital may be 
another VSP or any other."
"The VSP will submit the claim to VMIU field office to enter those into the database,"
"The filed office will validate the claim form manually and through system,"
"If any of mandatory information is missed or any false information is existing 
then the field office will reject the claim back to VSP and 
the system will keep those claim in a quarantine area"
"The quarantined forms will be sent back to the VSP for verification, if the VSP 
returns the claim with satisfactory details, the claims will be entered on to the system, 
in the following month’s batch."
"Based on the payment terms agreed by VSP, the field office will generate 
BiMonth or Monthly financial and medical report and send it to MSIU Admin team to arrange 
the payments for the VSP."
"To understand the satisfaction of client the MSIU Admin team will get client feedback 
from some of the clients and send those documents 
to field office to enter those into database."
"As mentioned above the entire system is sub-divided into six modules 
and again the each module 
is subdivided into different subsystems."
"The created unique numbers are then printed out in the form of bar-codes, which will 
complement (or stuck on the voucher) the voucher."
"Then at every level on the voucher 
cycle this number is captured, on distribution, retail sales, point of treatment, enclosed 
along with claim forms, at the claims processing and finally for the payment."
"Each voucher should have the 
following properties, which will have sub-elements to get the batch numbers, voucher 
numbers, and the project codes."
"Additionally the provision for validity date check for the period of vouchers to be
used in the program is provided."
"If the tear off voucher slips would be sticker then it will not be lost on attaching to 
the claim 
forms by the VSP."
"Once created vouchers will not be edited or deleted but there will be a provision 
to with-hold any voucher number if the admin 
team decides to do for any reason."
"The system will capture the master details of every distributor so that 
the users can get the details of any distributor and sales details at any time."
"such valid information will help us track 
information related to sales and distributions."
"On capture of any duplicate name the system 
will give a warning message to have the duplicate name or to change the name."
For better reporting purposes it is better to have a differentiating indicator on the name.
"There will be a provision to select a particular distributor to view the details 
(e.g."
"Delete
(deleting will be allowed only if no child records are created)"
"Active/Deactivate
 (if the distributor has to be deactivated or terminated)"
"There will also be a provision for the other users to view the details of a
 distributor with purchase and sales details."
"The system will capture the details of MSIU Salesman; this would help 
the MSIU management team to understand the performance of each Team or salesman."
The Salesman master should capture following information’s.
Sales-team (which will have a separate master)*.
"The sales team master is for the future development of this program, 
if this program is extended to a country-wide network, 
this master will help understand and tack sales information."
"On capture of any duplicate 
name the system will give a warning message to have the duplicate name or to change 
the name."
"For better reporting purposes 
it is better to have a differentiating indicator on the name"
"During the distribution the system will capture the 
following details, to make Distribution process easily."
Invoice amount = No of vouchers x Wholesale price
"Suppose the distributor or salesman name is not available in the system, then the 
system has a provision to navigate quickly to its master screen and enter the new 
Distributor and Salesman details, 
without closing the present screen."
"While entering the No of vouchers required, the system should automatically 
pick the Batch No’s with voucher No’s from the available voucher stock and list the 
details of each voucher with below information’s as a grid format."
"The program will take maximum care in this form and table, as it 
become a vital transaction to be captured."
"In this module you will see that every 
capture of data will be 
validated and checked on saving into the database."
"the capture of voucher 
number, clinical information, diagnosis details, drug and investigation details and 
the costs are going to provide the program a vital report information."
"Other than Contact No and E-Mail Id all other information are mandatory 
during the creation of a new Service Provider."
"The system should generate message with two option “Continue – Yes/No” while the 
user trying to create a new VSP with an existing name, If the user press Yes the 
system will allow the user to enter the same, if not the system wont allow the new 
entry to save."
"The system will list District, Sub-District, County, Sub-County, Village / Town 
from the master during VSP creation, if any of them are not available in the system, 
then the system will have the provision to navigate quickly to its master screen and 
do enter master details and back to VSP screen."
"If any of the information is not available in existing master of 
above, then the system will have the provision to navigate quickly to its form to 
enter the master details and back to VSP Screen."
"But if the system is found more than two fraud entries during the claim process of 
particular VSP, then the system would automatically change the status of that particular 
VSP as In-activate."
"The system will capture following master details to fill 
the payment terms."
The below details may periodically change depends on the MSIU management decision.
"The above mentioned payment terms will help the MSIU to make the 
payment detail easy and also help the VSP to get their payment in timeThe system will 
control the payment process and terms."
"The allowed users only can able to Add, Modify 
or delete the VSP master information including payment terms."
"The 
system will facilitate to show the user following details if necessary."
"The system will have the facility to capture the details of VSP staff 
details and the necessary master information 
while entering the claim into the system."
"The system will generate message while creating a new staff with 
existing name, but the system will allow 
the user to save that new staff if its required."
"For example HP0001SC0001  
Staff type (should be select from list of staff type listing from Staff Type Master)  
If any of the staff type is not available in the system, then the system should 
have the provision to navigate quickly to staff type master 
to enter the new staff type and then back to Staff Master screen."
"Depends on the payment terms (Bi-monthly / Monthly) mentioned in 
the VSP master the VSP should submit the Claim (Treatment form) to the MISU Field 
office."
"While submitting the Claim (Treatment Form) to MSIU, the system will have 
the provision to capture the following details."
"The above details would print in the report header and below details 
will print 
in the detailed part of the report"
"The claim entry is purely based on the Treatment (claims) Form submitted 
by the VSP."
"Before the claim entry the user should check the form manually to understand 
whether any mandatory information is missed in the Claim or not."
"If yes, then the user 
should mark that Claim (Treatment Form) status as Rejected and send back to VSP."
"All above master level information are mandatory other than 
Contact No during the entry of claim into the system."
"The following part will 
explain how the systems 
will validate every information during claim entry."
"Treatment Form No (List Form No from Claim receipt details which all are not 
yet entered in claim)"
Submitted Date (This should populate automatically while choosing the Form No)
VSP Name (This should populate automatically while choosing the Form No)
"Address (Street / Road, District, Sub-District, County, Sub-County, Village / 
Town) other than Street / Road all other details would list from the its master records, 
if any details are not exist in Master record, then the system should have the provision 
to navigate quickly to its master screen to enter the new details 
and back to the Claim Entry Screen"
"Doctors Note – 
Space for the doctor to enter the note about the patient if anything is 
required"
"HIV Details if any –
The format for HIV capturing details are attached with SRS."
"Patient Status -
(Select from list of status options populating from Patient Status Master) 
suppose the status is Referral then the system will have the provision to capture 
Referred To and Reason for Referral, the reason for Referral 
should be populated from Referral master."
"Claim Status –
Status of the claim is depends information available in the 
Claim, if any false data or any mandatory information is available in 
Claim, then the claims status will change, if the value of status is not 
“Accepted” then the claim will be stored in quarantine area and can able 
to precede it further from its status."
"The system should have a provision 
to capture the reason suppose if the claim status is “Rejection or Quarantine”"
If it is a First visit Claim
"Claim Amount will capture First Follow up Fee (from VSP Payment terms) + 
(Qty of drugs * Retails Price (from Drugs Master)"
"The system captures the thump impression available in each claim 
form, and needs to compare it with the same voucher numbers previous visits 
if available."
"If the thump impression are mismatching for the same patient 
(Client / Partner) on same voucher the system would automatically make a count on it."
"If the claim from same VSP having more than two times of Thump Impression 
mismatching, then the system should automatically produce a warning message 
and the same time the system should In-Activate the VSP."
The authorized user can alter / amend the Claim if required.
System only accept claims only if the mandatory information is complete
"Voucher Sales return is feature used when a distributor is planning to 
return the vouchers back to the MSIU sales team."
"While entering return vouchers details the system will check weather 
the returned voucher was sold to this particular Distributor or not."
"MSIU team collects the client feed back from the clients who 
got treatment through the voucher system."
"The user will not alter any information about treatment, 
which is populating from the system"
"Monthly after claim collection on claims, where payment 
shall be withheld until clarification"
"Report, summarising all providers"
"The above is the masters part information and below are 
the transaction part information."
Allow above information are mandatory while creating a new User Group.
The system admin only can able to create User Groups

Password and Verify password values are equal"
"The system should not allow the user to create a User 
Group and Individual User with existing names"
This document describes the Public Health Information Network (PHIN) functional requirements for systems implemented to participate in the management of outbreaks and other health events.
"Outbreak Management (OM) is the PHIN functional area intended to support the needs of investigation, monitoring, management, analysis, and reporting of a health event or act of bioterrorism."
OM should aid in the collection and analysis of data to support identifying and containing the health event.
"OM systems should be configurable to meet the needs of different types of health events, and capture data related to cases, contacts, investigations, exposures, relationships, clinical and environmental specimens/samples, laboratory results, vaccinations and treatments, travel history, and conveyance information."
The application should also allow for new objects to be defined and created during the course of an investigation.
"Systems supporting OM should also be integrated with the systems supporting early event detection, countermeasure administration, laboratory, and surveillance to achieve the primary goal of managing the response to and mitigating the effects of an event."
This document provides minimum operational requirements necessary to support an outbreak management system and should in no way preclude a system from incorporating additional functionality beyond what has been covered in this document.
The following requirements describe baseline functionality for any system(s) implemented to support Outbreak Management:
"2.2 Data Requirements: Systems supporting OM need a variety of data to support investigations, including data regarding demographics, cases, exposures, investigations, agents, contacts, specimen/sample collection, laboratory tests, travel and conveyance, and restriction monitoring."
"2.3 System Functions and Behaviors: Systems supporting OM should support case investigation, maintain detailed and comprehensive linkages, trace contacts, and quarantine and isolation monitoring activities."
"2.4 Analysis, Visualization, and Report Generation: Systems supporting OM should enable investigators to produce both aggregated and individual reports about affected entities and events."
"Where they exist, systems supporting OM should use them."
"As additional standards are defined, they should be accepted and implemented"
"2.7 Operations: Personnel, roles, activities, and responsibilities necessary to support all aspects of OM should be clearly defined."
A plan must be established for continuing activities when systems supporting OM are unavailable.
"Systems designed to support OM must offer configuration flexibility so that new data fields, entities, entity types and relationship types may be added to capture information unique to each particular health event."
"Systems supporting OM must support structured data entry for common forms and fields to ensure data integrity, validity, and standardization."
"A standardized data structure ensures that data mapping of common elements will only be necessary one time, rather than for each event."
"Systems supporting OM should support multiple deployment options (e.g., client server, disconnected, and potentially web based)."
Systems supporting OM should provide the ability for computers in disconnected mode to reconnect to a server to share OM data among other computers that operate in disconnected mode.
OM data should be synchronized so that all instances of OM applications working from the same server are able to share and use the same data.
Systems supporting OM should be able to electronically record and store data from remote devices that may be uploaded to an aggregating system.
"Systems supporting OM should be capable of using configurable, domain-specific vocabulary."
"The following high-level data requirements are necessary to ensure that the data being collected, analyzed, and reported to support OM are clearly defined."
Each type of entity requires specific data to be collected.
"Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture demographic data about persons involved in an OM investigation, including: Subject ID, name, address, date of birth, gender, phone number, race, ethnicity, and country of citizenship."
"Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture data about organizations (e.g., a local health department, a university, a professional association) involved in an OM investigation, including: organization name, location, and contact information."
"Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture data about locations involved in an OM investigation, including: name (if applicable), type (e.g., floor, building, room, store), street address, city, state, zip code, country, GPS coordinates, and other specific details (e.g., a specific building on a campus, a business branch location, a local chapter’s meeting hall)"
"Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture data about any animals involved in an OM investigation, including: type (dog, monkey, etc), age, gender, owner’s name and address, color, weight, and species."
"It may be a challenge to ensure unambiguous identification because demographic details of an animal are not easily identified; therefore, animals involved in investigations may need to be tagged."
"Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture data for any object involved in an OM investigation, such as a letter, invoice, food item, or any object that cannot be classified as a “person, organization, place, or animal.” Collected data may include: name of the object, type, physical descriptors, address, identification number (e.g."
"Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture data about any public or private gathering of people (e.g., church social, ball game) involved in an OM investigation, including: time, location, nature of the event, etc."
"Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture data about any living things other than persons or animals that are involved in an OM investigation, including: type of living thing, and other customizable data collection questions."
"Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture an entity’s travel history to support investigations of entities infected, exposed or potentially exposed."
"When a health event is investigated, it must be assigned an event identifier (i.e., Event ID) that is unique within the jurisdiction."
"environmental, infectious), the date the event began, the suspected agent (if known) or investigation focus, the geographic area impacted by the event, as well as the event status (e.g., open, closed)."
Systems supporting OM should have the ability to record the case definition for a health event.
Systems supporting OM should have the ability to capture changes to the case definition that occur as the health event evolves.
"Travel history provides specific information to indicate when, where, and how subjects involved in an event traveled to a location (or to multiple locations), and conveyance data describes the vehicle in which the travel occurred."
"For example, if a person who lives in Georgia travels to Seattle and becomes exposed to monkey pox, then visits a friend in Santa Fe, travel history and conveyance data should be noted accordingly for each place the exposed person traveled."
"Detailed conveyance data must be collected when relevant to the investigation, including the carrier identifier, the type of conveyance (such as airplane, bus, or train, among countless others), as well as the make, model, year, and identification number (e.g., VIN) of each vehicle with which the entity was in contact (if this information is relevant to the investigation)."
"Because attributes of both case and exposure data may describe the same entity, systems supporting OM must have the ability to avoid capturing redundant entity demographic information."
"Case data about the entity should include: a case identifier (i.e., Case ID) that is unique within the jurisdiction being reported, the suspected agent, case diagnosis, health status (e.g., no symptoms, acute illness), case status (e.g., confirmed, probable, suspect), investigation dates, clinical history, symptom onset date and time, epidemiological links to other cases, and priority (e.g., high, medium, low)."
There must be a means to update the case diagnosis either manually or automatically if the case definition changes during an event.
Epidemiological (epi) data must be collected to assist in the case investigation of events.
"Standard epi data to be collected includes: onset date and time of symptoms, type of symptoms, risk factors, medical history data, laboratory data, procedure data, and questionnaire responses."
"Demographic information should be collected about the investigator, including their name, address, and contact information, so that the investigator may be contacted to answer questions or to provide additional information."
"For example, if a person becomes ill during travel in one jurisdiction but is the resident of another, the illness will be reported by the state (jurisdiction) of residence and investigated by the jurisdiction visited."
Systems supporting OM should have the ability to classify entities associated with the investigation as investigation controls.
"For example, controls share demographic characteristics with the subject of the case, but are not infected with the agent that is the focus of the investigation."
"Exposure investigation data to be captured must include information related to exposure levels, type of exposure (e.g., intimate, social, household, common conveyance), place of exposure, length of time the entity was exposed, frequency of exposure, and the entity’s proximity to the source of exposure."
"Exposure data related to both the potential source and the potential spread include the entity’s type, Subject ID, Contact ID, contact’s name and address, exposure dates and times, health status, and priority code."
Epi data must be collected to assist in the exposure investigation of health events.
"Standard epi data to be collected for exposure investigation parallels the data to be collected for case investigation and includes: onset date and time of symptoms, type of symptoms, risk factors, laboratory data, procedure data, and questionnaire responses."
"Systems supporting OM must support capturing dynamic, event-specific data that describes contact between two subjects."
Monitoring and follow-up data is used to track the progress and treatment of subjects who were exposed or potentially exposed to a health event.
Systems supporting OM should support the monitoring and follow-up activities required when tracking the status of cases and exposed individuals.
Monitoring data should be collected about cases and exposed individuals who are isolated or quarantined because of a health event.
Follow-up data should be collected from subjects or their proxies to track symptoms and compliance with recommended treatment plans or prophylaxis.
"Follow-up data may be received from take response exams of persons who received a countermeasure that requires such an exam (i.e., smallpox vaccination)."
"Specimen/sample collection and laboratory response data supports the collection of clinical specimens, food samples, environmental samples, and other types of samples that will be tested for biological, chemical, and radiological agents."
"Specimens/samples collected for laboratory testing must be assigned an identifier (i.e., Specimen ID) that is unique within the jurisdiction."
"The subject of a specimen/sample collected for laboratory testing must be linked to the specimen/sample by an identifier (i.e., Subject ID) that is unique within the jurisdiction."
Systems supporting OM must be able to store data about the specimens/samples that are collected for laboratory testing.
"Examples of this data are: Specimen ID, Subject ID, purpose for test, collection date and time, subject type (e.g., human, plant, animal, food), specimen category, specimen type, suspected agent, risk indicator (e.g., infectious, radioactive, corrosive), person performing specimen/sample collection (including contact information), location of collection, and volume and quantity details."
"Clinical specimen data should include information about the specimen source/site from which the specimen was taken, symptom date of onset, and whether the sample is acute or convalescent."
"Environmental sample data should include information about the collection method, location (geocoded if possible) from which the sample was taken, source (e.g., rain or well for water, radiation release, asbestos, chair or desk in a specified location), nature of the sample (e.g., soil, water, air), quality control data, collection begin and end date and time for air samples, and original volume and volume of concentrate tested for water samples."
"Food sample data should include information about the lot number, batch number, manufacturer name, shipping invoice, temperature, sample type (e.g., dairy – milk, red meat, spice), and product storage condition."
"Chain of custody information for forensic and select agent samples must be captured, including the person who collected the sample, the location of collection, all people who came into contact with the sample during the preparation for shipment to the laboratory, and the acceptance of the package by the shipper."
Systems supporting OM must be able to create a laboratory test request for a specimen/sample or group of specimens/samples.
"Information about batch shipments of specimens/samples that are transferred to test laboratories or other facilities must be collected, including the shipper (e.g., UPS, FedEx), shipment tracking number, and the sending organization’s contact information."
"Systems supporting OM should be able to support the inclusion of labeling, packaging and shipping instructions (e.g., container type, storage condition, preservative), and the shipping manifest with batch shipments of specimens/samples."
Systems supporting OM must be able to store laboratory result(s) and link the result(s) to the original laboratory test request.
"Examples of this data include the Specimen ID, Subject ID, test date and time, test type (LOINC), data for each organization involved in the testing of the specimen/sample (e.g., testing or reference laboratory name, location, contact information), laboratory results and result values (SNOMED), other data such as unit of measure for result value, overall interpretation, and any relevant notes."
"If the specimen/sample collection record exists, the laboratory result must be linked to the specimen collection record by the Specimen ID."
"If the specimen/sample collection record does not exist, the laboratory result must be linked to the subject by the Subject ID."
"Systems supporting OM should capture or be linked to data regarding the prophylaxis or treatment to cases, exposed individuals, or at risk persons, including the person who ordered the prophylaxis or treatment, and the name, date, type, duration, and dosage of the treatment or prophylaxis given."
"Contraindication information should be collected to indicate why vaccinations, treatments, or antidotes may not have been administered or why the patient may not have complied with prescribed interventions."
"If an affected person suffers a negative reaction to a vaccine or prophylaxis that was administered, adverse event data may be collected and used to determine the need for additional interventions or to determine if there is a problem with the pharmaceutical, batch, or the administering facility or person."
"Systems supporting OM should capture information such as the date and time of an activity, activity type, who initiated the activity, and contact information to generate activity logs for management purposes."
"Activity logs, which are tools for investigators to track their actions during a case, should be supported."
"For example, investigators may log calls made to monitor symptoms or calls made to schedule follow-up visits."
Activity logs may also provide information needed to support communication with various jurisdictions in the event that the investigation crosses jurisdictional boundaries.
"For example, if a person becomes ill during travel in one jurisdiction but is the resident of another, the illness will be reported by the state (jurisdiction) of residence, rather than by the jurisdiction visited."
"They will be designed by investigators to collect common data elements (e.g., patient demographics, test results, exposure contacts), agent-specific data elements (e.g., specific laboratory test), and other customized data elements."
Case investigation should be supported by reusable questionnaire libraries that use common terminology (where available) to maximize the efficiency of data exchange.
Systems supporting OM should provide a manual or automatic means of updating the status of case records as the case definition changes.
Systems supporting OM should track the changes made to the status of case records as a result of changes in the case definition.
"Linkages allow investigators to create meaningful analysis, characterize the event, and identify at-risk populations."
"For example, person-to-person (e.g., family relationship, exposure relationship), person-to-place (e.g., household, common place), animal-to-person, object-to-place, person-to-travel."
Each new case must be able to link an assigned Entity ID to an Event ID within the scope of the investigation.
"Systems supporting OM require the ability to capture information about possible cases and potential contacts from the identification process through the treatment and follow-up process, as supported by linkages among entities, events, and actions."
"Laboratory results must be linked to corresponding specimens/samples including multiple results from one specimen/sample), and subjects when the participating laboratory returns the results."
These linkages must unambiguously associate multiple laboratory results to case and contact identifiers.
"If the specimen/sample was created from another specimen/sample (e.g., aliquots, and new specimen types created from a source sample), laboratory results for the child specimens/samples must be linked to the corresponding parent specimen/sample."
"Contacts of exposed entities (e.g., people, animals, places) may be traced, investigated, and monitored."
"Systems supporting OM should be able to create new contacts from existing case records, and should also identify the contact type."
"Systems supporting OM must support contact exposure tracing by allowing one contact to be linked to multiple cases, and allowing multiple contacts to be linked to a single case."
"Systems supporting OM should be able to produce contact work lists for each investigator to use, and should allow sorting by priority or geography."
"Systems supporting OM should have the ability to produce charts, maps, and graphs that illustrate OM data, such as epi-curves and the effect of vaccination or prophylaxis on the number of new cases (demonstrating the effectiveness in containing the health event) or maps that illustrate the number of cases by zip code."
"Systems supporting OM should generate electronic data dictionaries for dynamic data (or other user-defined data descriptions to assist with effective data exchange), line lists, activity logs, aggregate data, and call-back lists to assist the emergency response group and investigators in responding to and containing a health event."
"Reports generated by systems supporting OM should clearly indicate the number of cases, the number of contacts per case, the number of cases with no known epi-link at the time of diagnosis, the laboratory results, and the number of vaccinations and/or treatments administered."
"Systems supporting OM should have the ability to produce pre-formatted queries and reports to allow faster and more accurate reporting, while still allowing the flexibility of ad-hoc reporting."
Systems supporting OM should have the ability to produce individual reports for each emergency team member or investigator.
"Systems supporting OM should have the ability to compare characteristics of exposed and non-exposed (i.e., controls) persons."
"Systems supporting OM should have the ability to produce lists of action items (e.g., to do lists)."
Systems supporting OM must be able to aggregate data.
"Examples of aggregated data to be supported are: number of cases, number of contacts per case, and number of vaccinations and/or treatments administered."
"Health event data should be aggregated into a centralized data store (i.e., data warehouse) designed specifically to support analysis of events over time."
"SYSTEM INTEGRATION AND DATA EXCHANGE
Systems integration requirements specific to systems supporting OM are included in the section below and describe the types of data that OM should be able to send and receive."
This section is limited to describing the types of data exchange that OM must support; not the requirements for transporting the data.

"Systems supporting OM must be able to receive, parse and process messages for countermeasures that have been administered."
"This requirement is identified as a key performance measure for assessing preparedness as described in PHIN Preparedness Key Performance Measures, available at www.cdc.gov/phin."
Countermeasures that have been administered must be linked to the entity that was administered the countermeasures.
Systems supporting OM must be able to create and send messages for countermeasure administration requests.
"This requirement is identified as a key performance measure for assessing preparedness as described in PHIN Preparedness Key Performance Measures, available at www.cdc.gov/phin."
Systems supporting OM must be able to exchange aggregated data.
"Examples of aggregated data to be supported are: number of cases, number of contacts per case, and number of vaccinations and/or treatments administered."
"Systems supporting OM should be able to provide the aggregate data necessary for health event monitoring to systems that support response tracking, such as the number of suspect cases, number of persons under isolation or quarantine, and the number of patients receiving countermeasures."
Mapping interfaces and data dictionaries must be clearly defined and included in data exchanges to indicate and describe both standard and customized fields because systems supporting OM are configurable to meet the individual needs of each event and therefore collect data specific to each event.
"Systems supporting OM should support multiple file formats for import and export, such as databases, spreadsheets, messages, and text files, among others"
"It is recommended that standards be used across systems supporting OM; however, it is required that vocabulary standards be used when exchanging data."
"Vocabulary requirements that span PHIN functional areas should be reviewed in “PHIN Preparedness Cross Functional Components Requirements”, available at www.cdc.gov/phin."
"Operational requirements, such as system backup policies and procedures, continuity of operations, system monitoring, and employee training ensure that public health partners can effectively support activities in OM and other PHIN functional areas."
"Policies and procedures for communicating information to appropriate stakeholders (e.g., state and federal emergency management organizations, FEMA, hazmat teams, public works facilities, intelligence organizations, the media, and the public) should be clearly defined."
Polices regarding data synchronization should be defined to support multiple deployment options as discussed in section 2.1 System Architecture of this document.
Configuration management protocols and personnel should be identified to support multiple deployment options.
Protocols and personnel should be identified to support the set-up and configuration of laptops and other field devices used in OM investigations.
"Processes and personnel should be identified to support agent-specific deployment packages, including syndromic grouping libraries and vocabulary sub-sets, which will be used to efficiently collect data specific to the particular health event being investigated."
"Policies and procedures should be in place for determining when follow up and isolation and quarantine monitoring should be done as a part of a focused countermeasure administration and response effort, rather than as a function of contact exposure tracing."
"Security and Availability requirements that span PHIN functional areas should be reviewed in “PHIN Preparedness Cross Functional Components Requirements”, available at www.cdc.gov/phin."
Privacy requirements ensure that sensitive information is not accessibly to unauthorized uses.
Privacy requirements are broadly defined because they span all PHIN functional areas.
"These requirements should be reviewed in “PHIN Preparedness Cross Functional Components Requirements”, available at www.cdc.gov/phin."
"Figure 1-1 shows how the EIRENE system is covered in this specification, by
associating each element of the system with its corresponding section number(s)."
"It also intends to provide
manufacturing economies of scale wherever practical."
"The EIRENE System Requirements Specification defines the set of requirements which
a railway radio system shall comply with in order to ensure interoperability between
national railways."
"The specification distinguishes between requirements affecting a railway’s network
infrastructure, onto which mobiles will roam, and the requirements concerning
mobiles which may be used in any EIRENE compliant network."
"It is mandatory that
each railway meets these specifications where interoperability on lines, or
equipment interoperability, is required."
"Whilst not being
mandatory for interoperability, when the option is selected, the method defined in
the SRS and FRS by which such features are implemented becomes mandatory,
both to provide a consistent service and to present a recognised and agreed
standard to manufacturers in order to obtain economies of scale in development
and manufacture."
"These are statements
intended to provide explanatory notes."
"To meet additional functionality and
performance requirements, this standard is to be supplemented by: (I)"
"exchange of number and location information between train and ground to support
functional and location dependent addressing;"
"The scope of the specification is shown in figure 1-2, showing the hierarchy of the
GSM, and railway features to be implemented."
"Compliance to the list of normative documents is mandatory for all of the GSM
services necessary to provide the functionality specified in the [EIRENE FRS]."
"Later releases of these specifications may be used, providing that the system is
backwards-compatible with the versions listed."
The system is based on the GSM architecture which is summarised in figure 1-3.
"The
NSS contains mobile services switching centres (MSCs) with primary responsibility
for call control."
"The MSC is supported by a visitor location register (VLR)
containing temporary details of subscribers active within the MSC area, a group
call register (GCR) containing attributes of voice group and broadcast call
configurations for the related MSC area and home location registers (HLRs)
holding subscriber details on a permanent basis."
"The gateway GPRS support node (GGSN) is a
location register function storing subscription information and routeing
information (needed to tunnel packet data traffic destined for a GPRS MS to the
SGSN where the MS is registered) for each subscriber for which the GGSN has at
least one PDP context active."
"It interfaces to the SGSN via the Gn interface, to the
HLR via the Gx interface, to external packet data networks via the Gi interface and
to other GSM/GPRS networks via the Gp interface."
"Signalling within the NSS and between NSSs is carried out according to signalling
system number 7, SS7, making specific use of the mobile application part (MAP) of that
standard."
"Railway networks may implement a short message service centre to be interfaced to
the GSM network in order to support railway specific messaging applications."
A railway GSM network is also likely to have external interfaces to: (I)
"Standardised interface protocols are to be provided to allow applications external to
EIRENE to access EIRENE bearer services."
"To meet the specific railway requirements, a number of additional features are
required some of which have been incorporated in the GSM Standard."
"Equipment is to be capable of operation in the following frequency bands:
(I)"
"Note: the R-GSM band includes the Public GSM (P-GSM) and Extended GSM (E-GSM)
bands."
"All mobiles are to support these services as
defined in the relevant GSM specifications."
"This GSM specification is to be
implemented in order to achieve the high performance requirements necessary for
emergency group calls."
"It is also necessary to meet different grades of service
requirements for different types of communications traffic on the system (eg safety (eg
train control system), operational and administrative communications)."
"Many railway staff need to be addressed by functional rather
than personal numbers."
"The
principal example is that of train drivers, who need to be addressed by train numbers
which change with each journey."
"To overcome this difficulty a translation facility will
be provided to allow calls to functional numbers to be forwarded to the most
appropriate personal number at that time."
"A follow-me service will be implemented in the EIRENE network using the GSM
Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) facility to allow users to establish
and terminate the forwarding of calls from a functional number to their personal
number."
"Train drivers need to be able to contact controllers
and other staff at the push of a single button."
"As the train moves through different
areas, controllers are liable to change."
"As a consequence it is necessary to provide a
means of addressing calls from a train to certain functions based on the location of the
train."
"The only source of location information available within the GSM network is the cell
that the train is in."
"However, there are a number of external sources from which more
accurate location information may be derived: (I)"
"This may be supplemented with additional information from external systems to
provide a greater degree of accuracy."
"Railway mobiles may support a direct communications mode whereby a
mobile can communicate with all other railway mobiles in a local area without the use
of GSM infrastructure."
Section 2 lists the services and facilities which are to be supported by GSM-R networks.
"Note that for the handheld version of the General purpose radio,
commercial standards apply."
"Section 9 is concerned with a numbering plan
for the variety of functional numbers which are required."
"Section 10 details the
handling of other information, such as priority, closed user groups and encryption
algorithms, which must be applied consistently in all networks."
"The network services necessary to meet the range of UIC requirements are detailed
below."
"These services are to be considered as a minimum set for implementation
within each GSM-R standard network."
"Railways may implement additional network
services as desired."
"The GSM teleservices [EN 301 515, Index [24]] to be supported are indicated in table 2-1."
"The GSM bearer services [EN 301 515, Index [23]] to be supported are listed in table 2-2."
"Note: The Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR) CODEC is not suitable for voice group calls or
for voice broadcast calls."
"The GSM supplementary services [EN 301 515, Index [9]] to be supported are listed in table
2-3."
"The applicability of these supplementary services to GSM basic services will be as
indicated in [GSM 02.81-02.89 and EN 301 515, Index [28]]."
The railway specific services to be supported are listed in table 2-4.
"The call waiting service (CW) permits a party A to be notified of an incoming call from
party C whilst the traffic channel is not available for the incoming call and party A is
engaged in an active call with party B."
"However call waiting does not operate during
the prior set up of the call between the parties A and B (including alerting if used)."
"Therefore the alerting duration has to be as short as possible in order to minimize the
risk for the party A of missing notification of an incoming call from party C with a
higher eMLPP priority."
"Taking into account technical and operational aspects, it is
recommended to set the relevant timer(s) in the network in such a way that the
maximum alerting duration is limited to 60s."
"EIRENE mobiles are specified to conform to a common minimum standard of
performance."
"It is the responsibility of national railways to design their EIRENE
networks to provide the required level of service to EIRENE compliant mobiles."
"coverage probability of 95% based on a coverage level between 41.5 dBmV/m and
44.5 dBmV/m (-95 dBm and –92 dBm) on lines with ETCS levels 2/3 for speeds
above 220km/h and lower than or equal to 280km/h."
"The EIRENE mobile installation shall be designed to operate in a network meeting the
criteria in 3.2.2 and 3.2.3."
"Note 1: The specified coverage probability means that with a probability value of at
least 95% in each location interval (length: 100m) the measured coverage level
shall be greater than or equal to the figures stated above."
"The coverage levels
specified above consider a maximum loss of 3 dB between antenna and
receiver and an additional margin of 3 dB for other factors such as ageing."
"The values for ETCS levels 2/3 concerning coverage and speed-limitations are
to be validated and, if necessary, reviewed after the first operational
implementation of ETCS."
"The handover success rate should be at least 99.5% over train routes under design load
conditions (as given in [EN 301 515, Index [30]])."
"To avoid the necessity for large cell overlaps to accommodate high speed train
operations, optimisation of the handover process for such trains is considered
necessary."
"300ms represents our current best estimate
of the QoS figure, although this will need to be confirmed through user trials."
"An additional option is available to reduce the handover break period, namely the use
of the synchronous handover capability to reduce the break period to about 150ms."
"Synchronous handover requires the BTS transmissions in different cells to be
synchronised by the system."
"Each authority can decide whether it wishes to use
synchronised BTSs."
"Call setup time requirement is dependent upon the eMLPP priority of a call [EN 301 515,
Index [27]]."
"Call setup times as defined in the EIRENE FRS shall be achieved with authentication
and ciphering procedures enabled."
"Note: Authentication may be delayed if necessary to achieve the required call setup
times."
"Achievement of fast call setup times requires information in the setup message to be
compressed."
"The network shall operate in a sub-band, or combination of sub-bands, of the R-GSM
band as defined in [EN 301 515, Index [35]]."
"The UIC frequency band for GSM-R is defined in [CEPT 25-09], [1999/569/EC] and
[ECC(02)05]: (I)"
"For carriers in the UIC frequency
band the following convention shall be used, where Fl(n) is the frequency value of the
carrier ARFCN n in the lower band, and Fu(n) the corresponding frequency value in
the upper band: (M)"
Fl(n) = 890 + 0.2*(n-1024) 955 £ n £ 973
Fu(n) = Fl(n) + 45
"The minimum duration of a DTMF tone and the length of pause between tones
generated by the network (DTMF sender) and needed for the DTMF digit recognition
in the network (DTMF receiver) are specified in [3G TS 23.014, Support of Dual Tone Multi
Frequency (DTMF) signalling]."
"An entitled controller may terminate a VGCS/VBS call based on DTMF signalling [EN
301 515, Index [4] & [5]]."
"The network shall terminate the ongoing VGCS/VBS call if it receives the 3-digit
sequence “***” transmitted via DTMF signals."
"In order to minimise the discomfort caused by the DTMF tone added in the voice
channel, the duration of the tone generated by the fixed line dispatcher shall be 70ms ±
5ms, and there shall be a minimum gap of 65ms between each tone."
"The muting and unmuting for VGCS shall be in line with 
[EN 301 515, Index [4]]."
"The network shall send the SET-PARAMETER message with the attribute “D-ATT =
T”1 [EN 301 515, Index [6]] to the mobile station of the talking subscriber if it receives the 3-
digit sequence “###” transmitted via DTMF or the group call SETUP message2 from a
controller terminal."
"However, receiving the 3-digit sequence “###” or the group call
SETUP message related to an additional controller while any other controller is talking
shall not result in sending another SET-PARAMETER message with the attribute “DATT
= T”."
"When the network has detected the 3-digit DTMF sequence “###” transmitted via
DTMF from a controller terminal and if the controller was not previously talking it
should indicate its recognition by playing a single DTMF grant tone “#” of duration of
100ms ± 5ms to be sent to that controller terminal only."
"The network shall send the SET-PARAMETER message with the attribute “D-ATT =
F”3 [EN 301 515, Index [6]] to the mobile of the talking subscriber only if it has received the
3-digit sequence “#**” transmitted via DTMF from all the talking controllers4."
"To ensure interoperability, all EIRENE mobiles are specified with a common level of
basic services, facilities and features."
"This section of the specification gives details of
these core requirements, while sections 5-7 detail requirements specific to each of the
radio types."
"However, where implemented,
the requirements concerning this interface are mandatory for interoperability;

abandons the call."
"(M)
Note: For this, the higher layers of an EIRENE radio shall automatically repeat setup

EURORADIO [MORANE EURO FFFIS] shall be implemented."
"If implemented, the Public Address interface should comply with the specifications of
the UIC Fiche [UIC 568]."
"If implemented, the UIC interface should comply with the specifications of the UIC
Fiches [UIC 558, 568]."
"Where other data interfaces are implemented, they should be of the RS422 standard."
"Where necessary, a Train Interface Unit may be implemented to adapt on-train systems
to the standard interfaces provided by the Cab radio."
"This section identifies the EIRENE applications which may be used in the General
purpose radio and the functionality to be provided by the General purpose radio is
detailed."
"A standard data interface shall be provided to allow a computer to be connected to the
radio."
"The General purpose radio shall operate as a standard GSM terminal, supplying
mobile services as defined in section 4."

"Upon switch on, once the radio is connected to a mobile network, it shall be able to
receive all calls made using the MSISDN or appropriate group call number."
"It shall be possible to register and deregister a functional number by the user entering
his functional number, which is transmitted to the ground along with the subscriber’s
IMSI, using USSD (see section 11)."
"The full environmental and physical specification of the General purpose shall be as
close as possible to that of a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) GSM mobile whilst
adhering to the specifications provided in section 4."
SIM cards should be fixed into the radio to protect against accidental loss.
"No specific mechanical requirements need to be placed upon the General purpose
radio over and above those defined in section 4."
"General purpose radios shall be equipped with rechargeable batteries capable of
providing a minimum of eight hours operation over the temperature range +18°C to
+25°C from a single charge, based on the following cycle (see section 4.5.21): (M)"
Changing the battery shall not result in the loss of data stored in the radio.
"No specific testing procedures need to be used on the General purpose radio over and
above those given in section 4."
"This section identifies the EIRENE applications which may be used in the Operational
radio and the functionality to be provided by the Operational radio is detailed."
"A standard data interface shall be provided to allow a computer to be connected to the
radio."
"The Operational radio shall operate as a standard GSM terminal, supplying mobile
services as defined in section 4."
Automatic self-testing of the radio shall use the GSM IMSI attach procedure.
"Upon switch on, once the radio is connected to a mobile network, it shall be able to
receive all calls made using the MSISDN or appropriate group call number."
"It shall be possible to register and deregister a functional number by the user entering
his functional number, which is transmitted to the ground along with the subscriber’s
IMSI, using USSD (see section 11)."
"Once an appropriate number has been obtained, the radio shall initiate a call to this
number with ‘Railway operation’ priority (see section 10.2)."
"Activation of the ‘Railway emergency call’ function shall cause the radio to initiate a
Railway emergency call as defined in section 13."
"The calling user’s functional number, if there is one, shall be passed to the network
using UUS1."
"The Operational radio should support direct mode communications as defined in
section 15."
"The Operational radio should support shunting mode communications as defined in
section 14."
"In addition, the Operational radio is specified to allow
its use in the operating environment experienced on the operational railway (eg
shunting and maintenance), with the specifications in this section taking priority over
those in section 4 where any discrepancy is identified."
"The Operational radio shall be capable of withstanding exposure to extreme
environmental conditions [IEC 721 part 1]."
The Operational radio shall conform to IP 54 [IEC 529/EN 60529] as a minimum.
"SIM cards shall be fixed into the radio such that they can only be removed by the use of
a tool."
"The Operational radio user shall be protected against all electrical hazards arising from
the mobile equipment as defined in [EN 50153]."
"Operational radios shall be equipped with rechargeable batteries capable of providing
a minimum of eight hours operation over the temperature range -10°C to +55°C from a
single charge, based on the following cycle (see section 4.5.21): (M)"
Changing the battery shall not result in the loss of data stored in the radio.
"No specific testing procedures need to be used on the Operational radio over and
above those given in section 4."
"Functional requirements relating to controller equipment specifications can be found in
the EIRENE Functional Requirements Specification [EIRENE FRS]."
"An entitled controller may terminate a VGCS/VBS call based on DTMF signalling [EN
301 515, Index [4] & [5]]."
"To terminate a VGCS/VBS call by DTMF signalling, the 3-digit sequence “***” shall be
used."
"In order to minimise the discomfort caused by the DTMF tone added in the voice
channel, the duration of the tone generated by the fixed line dispatcher shall be 70ms ±
5ms, and there shall be a minimum gap of 65ms between each tone."
"A group call controller who wishes to start talking (except in the case of an originator,
a joiner or a re-joiner speaking for the first time5) shall indicate his wish, for example
by pressing the PTT button, whereupon the 3-digit DTMF sequence “###” shall be
transferred."
"The terminal of the controller should receive a single DTMF grant tone “#” of duration
100ms ± 5ms sent by the network if it has detected the 3-digit DTMF sequence “###”
and if the controller was not previously talking."
"Any group call controller who wishes to stop talking shall indicate his wish, for
example by releasing the PTT button, whereupon the 3-digit DTMF sequence “#**”
shall be transferred."
"International standardisation of the numbering plan is required to ensure interworking
between networks."
"Furthermore, standardised allocation of numbers to subscribers is
likely to facilitate schemes for identification, barring etc."
"However, it may be generally assumed that numbers (excluding access
prefixes) will not exceed 15 digits in length and will consist entirely of the digits 1 to 9
and 0."
"Characters * and # may be used locally to gain access to special facilities such as short
code dialling."
"Each railway should have appropriate call-barring facilities to prevent unintended
access to the GSM-R network by non-authorised users."
"All Train Function Numbers and their associated MSISDN numbers shall be stored in
the same routing database, which is the database of the GSM-R network in which the
train is currently operating."
"The Engine Function Number(s) and associated MSISDN numbers shall at any time be
stored as an entry in the routing database of the home GSM-R network6 of the engine."
"The functional numbers of the Shunting Team Members, Maintenance Team Members
and Train Controller (and any associated MSISDN numbers) shall be stored as entries
in the routing database of the home GSM-R network."
"Implementation of the EIRENE numbering plan shall not prohibit any authorised
caller from using the MSISDN number where known, thus enabling mobiles to be
assigned to particular personnel where this is appropriate."
"The numbering of Service Areas for group calls and broadcast calls shall be made in
accordance with GSM Technical Specifications [EN 301 515, Index [21] & [4]] and [EN 301 515,
Index [22] & [5]] respectively."
"The EIRENE network can not be considered as a fully private network, as some parts
of either the mobile or fixed networks may be provided by public operators."
"To achieve integration of the EIRENE numbering plan with the national public
numbering plan, telephone numbers have to be allocated by the various numbering
regulatory bodies on a national basis."
"If functional numbers are to be used outside the
EIRENE network, they will require either a public number allocation or, alternatively,
an EIRENE Network Access Number (ENAN) may be used as described in 9.11 (I)"
"The EIRENE numbering plan shall be standardised to allow interoperability and shall
be implemented as a private numbering plan within the GSM-R network."
"These numbers do not comply
with a numbering plan that can be interpreted by telephone switches and are therefore
not supported by the call routing solution given in section 11."
"If alphanumerical numbering is required within a railway network, then these
numbers may either be translated at the user terminal into a subscriber number or
conveyed between the calling party and a routing database using a nationally
determined approach."
"National EIRENE Number (NEN):
this number is used to route a call from the
calling party to a called party registered within the same GSM-R network;"
"International EIRENE Number (IEN):
this number is used to route a call from the
calling party to a called party registered within another GSM-R network;"
"Short Dialling Code (SDC):
this number is used to allow ’speed dialling’
functionality."
"In addition, Breakout Codes (BCs) shall be used to allow users within the GSM-R
network to access external numbers."
National EIRENE Numbers are used to set up calls within a single GSM-R network.
"Every railway network shall consider a number as a National EIRENE Number (NEN)
unless the number is preceded by an International Code, identifying another GSM-R
network."
"The National EIRENE Number shall consist of three distinct parts, as shown in figure
9-1: (M)"
"1) Call Type:
The Call Type (CT) prefix is used to distinguish between the different types of
User Numbers that are allowed within the national EIRENE numbering plan."
"1234 and 123), a risk exists when dialling
a number by keying in individual digits e.g."
"In this
circumstance the risk of connecting to an un-intended train exists if there is a
delay between keyed-in digits."
"There is no risk of ambiguity if block dialling is
employed."
"Engine Number (EN):
a unique number given to a tractive unit to identify it
permanently."
"In order to call a particular
locomotive, it shall be possible to call a number associated with the tractive
unit's stock number."
"The actual number of the unit, which shall be used as the
EN, is based on the complete identification number."
"Coach Number (CN):
a unique number given to a coach (which is not a tractive
unit) to identify it permanently."
"The UIC has introduced a uniform
identification marking for passenger rolling stock [UIC 438-1]."
"In order to call a
particular coach it shall be possible to call a number associated with the vehicle
marking."
"The actual number of
the coach is denoted by seven digits (positions 5 to 11 of the complete vehicle
marking), which shall be used as the CN7."
"3) Function Code:
The Function Code (FC) is used as an identification of, for example, the person or
equipment on a particular train, or a particular team within a given area."
1) Call Type (CT) This prefix defines how to interpret the User Number that follows.
"It shall consist
of one or two digits as defined in table 9-1."
"2) User Number (UN) The UN is variable in length and depends on the information on which it is
based."
"Train Function Numbers (TFN) shall take one of the forms as defined in
table 9-2."
"Leading zeros shall be used in those situations where the train
number is less than five digits."
"Engine Function Numbers (EFN) shall take the format as defined in table
9-3."
Coach Function Numbers (CFN) shall take the format as defined in table 9-4.
"The UIN field format for calls
to shunting teams and maintenance teams shall consist of a Location
Number (LN), which identifies the location where the called party is
registered, followed by a Function Code (FC)."
"The UIN field for calls to train controllers shall be a
Location Number (LN) which identifies the location where the called party is
registered."
"The FC field for calls to train controllers shall consist of two digits and be as
defined in table 9-7."
"The UIN field format for group calls shall be a
Service Area (SA) indicator, which identifies the area in which the group call
is to be active."
"GSM-R networks shall recognise International EIRENE Numbers starting with the IC
of the GSM-R network in which the calling party is currently operating as National
EIRENE Numbers."
"The International EIRENE Number shall consist of three distinct parts, as shown in
figure 9-2: (M)"
"International Code (IC), which shall be used to route calls to the appropriate
GSM-R network;"
"National EIRENE Number (NEN), which consists of the combination of Call Type
and User Number and which is used to identify the called party."
The fields of an International Functional Number shall be defined as follows: (M)
"1) International Code (IC)
The International Code field shall consist of three digits and shall be based on the
[ITU-T E.164] country code (XCC or CCC), allocated by the UIC on a networkby-
network basis."
"2) National EIRENE Number (NEN)
The format of the National EIRENE Number field shall be as defined in
subsection 9.5."
"It shall be possible for authorised subscribers of fixed and mobile networks to call
mobiles using the appropriate MSISDN number."
"The short dialling codes can be defined on a national basis, but it is essential that
certain codes be used on an international basis in order to achieve interoperability."
"In addition, the network shall support the special short codes as defined in table 9-11."
"Standardisation of UIC group addresses is required to provide interoperability
between the fixed railway networks within the GSM-R network."
"Access to other GSM-R networks may be possible by using an Access Code (AC) as
part of the dialled number if the NSN (National Significant Number) following the CC
(Country Code) is assigned by the national telecommunication regulator to the GSM-R
operator."
"Access to private networks shall be performed by using a BC, defined in table 9-12c."
"Note: All other CT9 numbers are reserved for railway national fixed networks and
systems."
"The GSM-R network shall allow users direct access to public networks, subject to call
barring restrictions."
"Where access to public networks is allowed, this shall be performed by using an
Access Code (AC), defined in table 9-13, followed by the international or national
number of the called subscriber as defined in [ITU-T 164]."
"Access to the GSM-R network should be performed by dialling an EIRENE Network
Access Number (ENAN)8, followed by the relevant National or International
Functional Number as defined in subsections 9.5 and 9.6 respectively."
"Provision should be made to prevent unauthorised calls to mobiles from outside the
GSM-R network."
"The Function Codes used in association with the Train Function Number (CT=2),
Engine Function Number (CT=3) and Coach Function Number (CT=4) shall conform
to table 9A-1."
"The Function Codes used in association with Maintenance Services Team Numbers
(CT=6) shall conform to table 9A-2."
"This appendix provides an overview of the numbering plan as defined in this section
of the EIRENE SRS, detailing the allocation of numbers within the National and
International EIRENE Numbering plan."
"In order to provide a consistent level of service in each railway network and, in
particular, to ensure interoperability for train drivers and other users roaming between
networks, it is important to harmonise subscription details and other information
stored in the network."
"In order to provide a consistent international service, it is necessary to ensure that
priorities are allocated consistently across all railways."
Levels 0 – 4 are designed to interwork with the ISDN MLPP service.
"User access classes are defined in GSM so that under critical conditions, part of the
user population can be barred from accessing the network in order to avoid
congestion."
"Access classes should not be used under normal network operating conditions, where
the GSM eMLPP may be used to provide a better grade of service to certain users."
"If special access classes (eg 12 - 14) are assigned within a railway’s network to certain
high priority users, it ought to be noted that when roaming, this will only have an
effect on a national public network, subject to bilateral agreement."
"Such facilities may be particularly important if public network access to the
radio system is provided (eg to prevent members of the public calling drivers and
drivers calling members of the public)."
"SIM cards shall contain a list of authorised networks so that networks shall be
displayed (or automatically selected if automatic network selection has been enabled)
in the following order of priority (see [MORANE SIM] for more details): (M)"
"The use of “Over The Air” in conjunction with the SIM Application Toolkit [EN 301 515,
Index [36]] to update SIM cards in the home network is recommended (see [MORANE SIM]
for more details)."
"Mobiles shall be capable of operation using algorithms for all countries in which they
need to roam."
"Each railway is free to implement its own authentication algorithms
without any resulting loss in cross-border interoperability."
"There is a requirement to be able to address communications to a ‘functional number’
rather than a more permanent subscriber number."
"This is an important issue which will affect interoperability and the ability to use
public network services."
"There are specific features of individual railways which make
it difficult to develop a concise and universally acceptable system within GSM."
"To accommodate the different requirements of the individual railways, the following
approach has been adopted: (I)"
"all responsibility for handling addressing lies with the network infrastructure and
other ground based equipment, rather than additional functionality in the mobile;"
"each railway will be responsible for implementing addressing schemes which best
meet its needs;"
"national addressing schemes are to use the internationally standardised groundtrain
protocol, based on a single standardised GSM service, for exchanging
information between the ground and mobiles."
"The first is related to passing information to provide an association between a mobile’s
subscriber number and its functional number."
"The latter is concerned with ensuring
that calls from a mobile terminal (in particular, Cab radios) are routed to the correct
destination (ie primary controller, secondary controller), based on the current location
of the mobile."
"Functional numbering provides the mechanism by which a mobile terminal, or an item
of equipment connected to a mobile terminal, can be addressed by a number
identifying the function for which it is being used."
"Mobile access to the functional numbering scheme for registration, deregistration and
re-registration shall apply the USSD messages and protocols over the air interface as
specified in the GSM Follow-me service."
"The implementation of functional numbering at a network level is left open for
national railways subject to the requirements for interconnecting EIRENE networks
identified in section 11.6."
"For communication over the (Um) air interface, the USSD messages and protocols as
specified in the GSM Follow-me service shall be used to manage the following types of
functional numbers: (M)"
"It shall be possible to limit user access to functional number registration and
deregistration facilities based on each of the types of functional number identified in
11.3.5."
"Where SI Supplementary Information represents the International Functional Number
(also called the International EIRENE Number), as defined in section 9.6.3."
Note: This table is for information only.
"The Follow Me service control sequences are
based on the USSD specified in [EN 301 515, Index [15]]."
"In the event of a registration procedure failing owing to the functional number already
being registered to another mobile, the Cab radio shall be capable of providing the user
with the ability to perform automatically the forced de-registration of the previously
registered mobile and the registration of this functional number to the user’s mobile."
"This shall result in the following sequence of actions being performed by the user’s
Cab radio (see 11.3.7 for details of message structure): (M)"
"Inform the user whether the registration of the functional number to the user’s
mobile was successful (performed by the mobile)."
"In the cases described in 11.3.9i and 11.3.9ii, national rules may dictate that, prior to or
instead of performing the sequence described in 11.3.9i steps 1-7, the user shall
perform a specified action (e.g."
"Deregistration shall only be performed by the subscription identified by the MSISDN
number which is associated with the functional number."
"Re-registration of on-train functional numbers based on the train number shall be
performed every time a train leaves one EIRENE network and enters into another
EIRENE network."
"Each railway should define a suitable time-out interval to be applied as part of the
deregistration procedure for on-train functional numbers."
"The exchange of information between EIRENE networks is handled by the GMSCs and
shall use the standardised protocol as detailed in section 11.6."
"Each national railway is responsible for implementing a suitable recovery mechanism
and ensuring that the use of unverified functional numbers is prevented."
"The calling party functional number shall be passed to the receiving mobile using the
User to User Signalling supplementary service (UUS1) during call setup."
"If the calling party functional number is not available or if the calling party is not
registered then the CLI of the calling party shall be displayed on the receiving mobile's
display."
"The user-to-user information element in the SETUP, ALERT or CONNECT messages,
as defined in [EN 301 515, Index [16]], shall be used to transfer the functional number of the
calling party to the called party."
"If no valid functional number is available, a fixed length User-to-User Information
Element shall be used with the following format: (M)"
Interconnection of EIRENE networks is required to allow international call routing.
"It
is not envisaged that any routing database information is exchanged between EIRENE
networks."
"The protocol used for routing of calls shall be Signalling System No 7 (SS7) as defined
by the ITU-T."
"Call setup between EIRENE networks using international functional numbers shall be
based on the combination of the Breakout-Code (BC) and International Code (IC) as
specified in section 9."
"The Country Code (CC) followed by the National Significant Number NSN (as
specified in ITU-T E.164, Chapter 6.2) shall be used as the Global Title, which forms
part of the Signalling Connection Control Part (SCCP) protocol messages and is used
for inter-network routing of messages."
"As a minimum, call routing using location dependent addressing shall be based on the
use of short codes in conjunction with cell dependent routing."
"Further information on cell dependent routing for location dependent addressing may
be obtained from [MORANE SSRS] [MORANE LDA FFFS] [MORANE LDA FIS]."
"If a more accurate way of location determination is used, then position information
shall be provided to the radio system which shall be used to associate the short code
with the correct called party subscriber number."
"If implemented, the use of location information from train-based systems external to
the radio system shall comply with the requirements stated in the enhanced Location
Dependent Addressing FRS and IRS [eLDA FRS and eLDA IRS]."
"Facilities shall be provided to prevent unauthorised calls to mobiles either by
functional number or MSISDN number from outside the EIRENE network."
"However, it is anticipated that individual national railways may have a
requirement for pre-defined messages, in which case the application will be specified
as part of individual national procurements."
"Where text messaging is implemented in the network, the Short Message Service (SMS)
shall be used."
"Train emergency calls (for Railway emergencies whilst not involved in Shunting
operations);"
"A Railway emergency call is a high priority call for informing drivers, controllers and
other concerned personnel of a level of danger requiring all Railway movements in a
pre-defined area to stop."
"Train emergency calls (for Railway emergencies whilst not involved in Shunting
operations);"
"This section describes the handling of high priority voice calls for Railway operational
emergencies and does not cover public emergency calls (ie handling of ‘112’ calls)."
"Railway emergency calls are defined as those calls of ‘Railway emergency’ priority (see
section 10) which are routed to a pre-defined user or group of users due to a railway
operational emergency."
"All Railway emergency calls shall be implemented using GSM VGCS (Specifications
[EN 301 515, Index [21] & [4]])."
"It shall be possible to configure Railway emergency group call areas to contain
combinations of cells controlled by one or more MSC(s) within one or more network(s)."
"Where Railway emergency group call areas are controlled by more than one MSC
within one or more network(s), a unique anchor MSC is defined for each group call
area."
"For international Railway emergency calls, in order to minimise call set-up times, it is
recommended that the anchor MSC always directly controls the cell where the Railway
emergency call was originated."
"The composition of each group is a matter for national implementation, although
all areas shall have a group defined for all mandated Group IDs."
"Each mobile shall store a list of emergency Group IDs in the SIM appropriate to its
function (the Cab radio will store Group ID 299 and 599 - see table 9-8)."
"All Railway emergency group IDs required for interoperability and appropriate to the
operation of the mobile shall maintain active status whilst the mobile is powered up."
"The fixed network user will only receive emergency voice calls if designated a
dispatcher or group member in any of the calls defined in the GSM GCR."
"If the requirement in 13.4.4 is implemented, as a minimum the location information
shall be provided by the GSM network (eg current cell or base station serving the
mobile)."
"The mechanism for transferring the functional number of the originating mobile to
controllers is defined in [EN 301 515, Index [6], Release 4] using the Information Element
“Compressed OTDI” in the Immediate Setup 2 message from the originating mobile."
"If the GSM Release 99 capability and the Immediate Setup 2 feature defined in [EN 301
515, Index [6], Release 4] are supported by the network, the network shall set the MSC
Release bit in the “Control Channel Description” information element to “1”."
"Otherwise, the MSC Release bit in the “Control Channel Description” information
element shall be set to “0” (zero) [EN 301 515, Index [41]]."
"For post-incident analysis it is important that the initiation and receipt of Railway
emergency calls by mobiles is confirmed by a message sent to a ground-based location
(and also registered in the train borne recorder, in cases where a train borne recorder is
connected to the Cab radio)."
"The application must be able to deduce that a
confirmation is necessary from the call priority, as all calls of ‘Railway emergency’
priority must be confirmed."
"Confirmation of Railway emergency calls shall be implemented using the User to User
Signalling supplementary service (UUS1)."
"Railway Emergency call confirmation messages shall be of eMLPP priority 4 -
“Railway information and all other calls” (see section 10.2)."
"Cab radio:
the engine number or train number (if registered);"
"other mobiles:
the user’s functional number (if registered)."
"Confirmation messages shall be sent to a confirmation centre using a defined short
code (see table 9-10), which shall be associated with the GSM network."
"In the case of Cab radio, details of the confirmation shall be passed to the train borne
recorder if a train borne recorder is connected to the Cab radio."
"The user-to-user information elements in the following messages, as defined in [EN 301
515, Index [16]], shall be used for the confirmation of high priority calls: (M)"
"The purpose of shunting mode is to provide an effective means of communication to a
group of personnel who are involved with a shunting operation."
"On entering shunting mode, the operational radio shall determine if any shunting
group ID is already activated on the SIM."
"If a shunting group ID is activated, the operational radio shall proceed to re-establish
the group call."
"If no shunting group ID is activated, the operational radio shall initiate a “regular
shunting mode ON” procedure as detailed in table 14-1."
"After the “regular shunting mode ON” procedure has been completed, the procedures
shown in table 14-2 and 14-3 shall be used to register the shunting leader and shunting
members to a dedicated group call."
"Two possibilities shall be available to the shunting leader when leaving shunting
mode: (M)"
"The procedure
that shall be used to release the group call is shown in table 14-4."
"Maintain group call the shunting leader leaves the dedicated group call
momentarily for the purposes of conducting other communications."
"The leader
may then rejoin the group when ready."
"The operational radio
procedure that shall be used to maintain the group call is shown in table 14-5."
"On entering shunting mode, the Cab radio shall determine if any shunting group ID is
already activated on the SIM."
"If a shunting group ID is activated, the Cab radio shall proceed to re-establish the
group call."
"If no shunting group ID is activated, the Cab radio shall initiate a “regular shunting
mode ON” procedure as shown in table 14-7."
"The Cab radio shall exit shunting mode by means of the “Leave shunting mode”
procedure as defined in table 14-8."
"The terminal application shall prevent members of a dedicated shunting team from
initiating a new call (unless they are registered as shunting team leader and have left
shunting mode using the “maintain group call” function described in 14.2.4)."
"Users shall be prevented from joining a dedicated shunting group by the EIRENE
terminal application unless a valid functional number for the group has been
successfully registered to the GSM-R network by their terminal."
"1) provide short range fall-back communications between train drivers and
trackside personnel in the event of failure of all railway and/or public GSM
services normally available;"
"2) provide short range communications for railway personnel operating in remote
areas where no GSM facilities are available."
"However, where implemented, the
following requirements shall be mandatory."
"Frequency modulated equipment conforming to [ETS 300 086] shall be used for direct
mode."
"Direct mode shall operate in simplex mode, a radio link that uses a single frequency for
alternate transmission and reception."
"Voice transmission from direct mode equipment shall be possible only when the Push-
To-Talk (PTT) button is pressed."
"The purpose of the common access channel is to provide a point of contact and
information for all direct mode users."
"For example, if one direct mode user wished to
initiate contact with another user, communication would begin with a request for the
desired partner on the access channel."
The presence of the GSM-R network shall be indicated to direct mode users.
"All terminals shall ensure that when GSM-R services are available, the user is
prevented from entering direct mode."
"All direct mode equipment shall provide the facility to broadcast an in-band audio
shunting link assurance signal as defined in subsection 14.4.2 of the [EIRENE FRS]."
"The scope of the Get Real website is limited to attracting and encouraging
Oregon high school students to take coursework leading toward a
baccalaureate degree in computer science (CS) at one of the seven Oregon
University System campuses."
"The scope of the Get Real website is to provide a high school teen friendly set
of web pages that are easy to navigate and at the same time provides
sufficient depth and information about careers in computer science."
"Two potential groups of viewers (students) exist: 1) students interested in CS
seeking more in-depth information about a CS career, and 2) college bound
students not necessarily interested in CS who might be attracted to a CS

"The EIRENE Functional Requirements Specification defines the requirements of a radio 
system satisfying  the  mobile  communications  needs  of  the  European  railways ."
"The scope of this specification is to provide interoperability for trains and staff crossing 
national or other borders between systems, and to provide manufacturing economies 
of scale wherever practical."
"The  primary  objective  of  this  specification  is  to  ensure  interoperability  along 
international lines which are generally high speed and cross suburban areas with a 
high level of traffic."
"It will be determined on a national basis whether 
different classes of service need to be defined for such routes."
"1.3.1     The  EIRENE  Functional  Requirements  Specification  defines  a  set  of  requirements 
which a railway radio system should comply with, in order to facilitate international 
interoperability between national railways and manufacturing economies of scale."
"This 
specification therefore defines the functional requirements, to ensure that core railway 
functionality is provided."
"1.3.2     The specification distinguishes between the requirements affecting a railways network 
infrastructure,  onto  which  mobiles  will  roam,  and  the  requirements  concerning 
mobiles which will be used in any EIRENE-compliant network."
1.3.3     The statements made in the specification are assigned to one of three categories:
It is mandatory that  each railway meets these specifications on lines where interoperability is required.
"Whilst  not  being  mandatory for interoperability, when the option is selected, the method defined in  the SRS and FRS by which such features are implemented becomes mandatory,  both  to  provide  a  consistent  service  and  to  present  a  recognised  and  agreed  standard to manufacturers in order to obtain economies of scale in development  and manufacture."
These are statements  intended to provide explanatory notes.
"1.4.1.1     To  meet  the functionality  and  performance  requirements  of  EIRENE,  the  following 
system services are required:"
1.4.1.4     The specification also provides core functional requirements for the controller position.

services."
1.4.2.3     Other applications for which EIRENE will provide the bearer service may include:
"2.1.1     The network services necessary to meet the range of UIC requirements are detailed 
below."

basis."
"9.5.1     Authorised users within the EIRENE network shall be able to receive calls from calling 
parties outside the EIRENE network."
"10.1.1     In  order  to  provide  a  consistent  level  of  service  in  each  railway  network  and,  in 
particular, to ensure interoperability for train drivers and other users roaming between 
networks,  it  is  important  to  harmonise  subscription  details  and  other  information 
stored in the network."
"10.1.2     For the purposes of defining common subscription profiles, a number of subscription 
types might be used, for example: (I)"
"10.2.2     In order to provide interoperability, priorities shall be allocated consistently across all

10.2.3     The lowest priority ongoing call shall be pre-empted before that of a higher priority.
"10.2.4     In the case where an EIRENE mobile attempts to make a Railway emergency call over a 
public  network,  the  ability  to  pre-empt  lower  priority  calls  (particularly  public 
emergency calls) may be inhibited, unless a special agreement is in place."
"Such facilities may be particularly important if public network access 
to the radio system is provided (eg to prevent members of the public calling drivers 
and drivers calling members of the public)."
"It shall be possible to activate or 
deactivate the mobiles subscription to these groups."
10.4.2     Activating a group on the mobile shall allow a user to receive a call from that group.
"10.4.3     Deactivating  a  group  on  the  mobile  shall  prevent  a  user  receiving  calls  from  that 
group."
"10.4.4     In  order  to  provide  interoperability,  Cab  radios  will  be  members  of  a  number  of 
standard groups:"
"10.5.1     Authorised networks shall be listed (or automatically selected if automatic selection 
has been enabled) in the following order: (M)"
"10.5.2     Where EIRENE facilities are not available within the currently selected network, the 
user shall be given a visible indication."
"10.6.1     The access matrix defines which subscribers are able to contact which other subscribers 
within the EIRENE network."
"10.6.2     Yes indicates that the network shall allow a call from the stated initiating party to the 
stated receiving party."
"Yes* indicates that the call shall be allowed at least for users 
on the same train."
"Open indicates that permissions for calls of this type are to be 
assigned  by  the  implementing  railway  according  to  their  specific  communication

"11.1.1     There is a requirement to be able to address communications to a functional number 
rather than a telephone number."
"11.2.1.1 An  addressing  scheme  shall  be  provided  which  permits  users  to  be  identified  by    
numbers corresponding to their functional roles rather than by numbers tied to the 
terminal equipment that they are using."
"11.2.1.2 The  primary  usage  of  functional  addressing  will  be  for  controllers  to  establish    
communications  with  train  drivers  by  making  use  of  the  train  number."
"The  train 
number will vary between journeys although EIRENE equipment in the cab is unlikely 
to change."
"11.2.1.3 Other  uses  of  functional  addressing  will  include  identifying  on-train  functions  and    
other users performing particular roles such as shunting team leaders, maintenance 
team members, etc."
"11.2.1.4 It shall be possible to assign up to a minimum of 3 functional numbers to an EIRENE    
user at any one time."
"11.2.1.7 A user shall be able to set up a functional number on one network, and cancel the    
number from another network."
"11.2.1.8 The  functional  number  shall  remain  valid  as  a  user  roams  from  one  network  to    
another."
"11.2.1.9 The functional addressing scheme shall be independent of specific configurations of    
mobile and terminal equipment."
"For example, the functional number of a conductor on 
board  a  particular  train  shall  be  the  same  irrespective  of  whether  the  conductor 
accesses  the  network  through  the  Cab  radio  or  has  a  separate  dedicated  EIRENE 
mobile."
"11.2.1.10It shall be possible to call EIRENE users by functional numbers from a wide range of    
terminals (EIRENE and non-EIRENE)."
"(All such calls will 
be subject to any access restrictions  see section 10.3.)"
"11.2.1.11The functional addressing scheme should permit calls to be routed from a controller to    
an international train within the control area without reference to any EIRENE system 
other than that providing service to the international train."
"Since the number    
must be independent of networks, each number must be unique across all networks 
(including implementation of EIRENE facilities on public networks)."
11.2.2.2 The functional number shall consist of numeric characters only.
"11.2.2.3 If  alphanumeric  numbers  are  applied  by  a  national  railway,  the  railway  will  be    
responsible for the translation to unique numeric functional numbers compatible with 
the EIRENE specification."
"11.2.3.1 The functional identity of the called user shall be presented to the user initiating a call    
and the functional identity of the initiator shall be presented to the user receiving a call."
"11.2.3.3 If the user initiating the call has more than one functional identity, the user shall be    
able to select, prior to call establishment, which functional identity is presented to the 
receiving user."
"11.2.3.4 In the case of Cab radio, when a train number is assigned as a functional identity, this    
shall take priority over other Cab radio functional identities, and shall be the functional 
identity for the Cab radio to be displayed to other users."
"11.2.3.5 The functional identity shall be presented to the user in a form which can be readily    
understood (eg driver of train abcd rather than abcd01 or xyz shunting team 3 
rather than xyz03)."
"11.3.1     Three  procedures  can  be  identified  for  managing  the  relationship  between  the 
functional number and the telephone number by the mobile user as defined below."
"11.3.2.2i It should be possible for the system to prevent certain types of users from registering 
functional numbers that they are not authorised to use, for example: (O)"
"11.3.2.3 It shall be possible to register up to ten functional numbers to items of equipment    
physically connected to the Cab radio within 30 seconds."
"11.3.2.4 The  registration  procedure  shall  provide  a  means  to  prevent  mis-allocation  of    
functional numbers during registration."
"11.3.2.6 The system shall provide a means to recover consistent data sets following a system    
failure  during  which  functional  addressing  facilities  are  lost."
"11.3.3.1 The functional addressing scheme shall be supported by a straightforward procedure    
for deregistration of functional numbers."
"11.3.3.3 It shall be possible to deregister up to ten functional numbers to items of equipment    
physically connected to the Cab radio within 30 seconds."
deregister a functional number which is no longer valid but which has not been  deregistered by the user;
"deregister, by overriding, another user of the same type (eg a driver can deregister  a train number that another driver has forgotten to deregister);"
"deregister, with one action, all functional numbers associated with the same mobile  (eg the driver deregisters all functions at the end of the journey)."
"11.3.4.1 To allow roaming between EIRENE networks, the system shall support a procedure for    
the re-registration of functional numbers after selection of a new network."
"11.3.4.3 After  automatic  re-registration  is  performed,  the  new  registration  details  shall  be    
displayed to the user."
"11.4.1     Location dependent addressing shall be provided to route calls for a given function to 
a destination number that is dependent upon the users location."
"11.4.2     The functions to which calls shall be routed based upon the location of the mobile shall 
include: (M)"
"11.4.3     The correspondence between the locations and the destination of the call shall be easily 
re-configurable  to  support  dynamic  changes  in  controller  area  boundaries  (eg 
controller  area  boundaries  will  change  from  peak  to  off-peak  periods  during  the 
working day or over longer periods, areas may change to match changes in railway 
organisation or traffic demand)."
"11.4.4     When  operating  with  location  dependent  addressing,  no  manual  action  shall  be 
required to update the system when a mobile moves between locations."
11.4.5     The location dependent addressing scheme shall be available to all mobiles.
"11.4.7     Where  greater  accuracy  for  location  dependent  addressing  is  required,  additional 
location information may be provided by systems external to EIRENE."
"Sources of such 
information may include: (O) 
a)  ground-based signalling systems; 
b)  on-train systems (eg ERTMS/ETCS equipment, balise readers, GPS etc)."
"12.1.1     There is a requirement that the EIRENE system can be used as a bearer to support an 
application connected to the radio for exchange of text messages between ground and 
mobile(s) or mobile and ground."
"12.1.2     The aim of this section is to define the features and level of performance required for 
this service in order to ensure interoperability."
"However, it is anticipated that individual national railways may have a 
requirement  for  pre-defined  messages,  in  which  case  the  application  should  be 
specified as part of individual national procurements."
"12.2.1     It should be possible to transfer text messages between ground and mobile(s) through 
the EIRENE system."
"12.2.2     In  order  to  ensure  interoperability,  the  service  is  optional  for  the  ground  and 
mandatory for the Cab radio."
"12.2.3     If a message is safety related, the safety mechanisms will be included at the application 
level and do not concern the EIRENE system."
12.3.1     The maximum length of a message segment shall be 96 characters.
"13.1.2     This section describes the handling of high priority voice calls for railway operational 
emergencies and does not cover public emergency calls (ie handling of 112 calls)."
"13.1.4     The type of call initiated shall be determined automatically, based upon the mode of 
operation of the radio."
"13.1.5     If the mobile is in shunting mode, the emergency call button shall initiate a shunting 
emergency call, otherwise the call shall be a Train emergency call."
"13.1.6     The Train emergency call shall be sent to all drivers and controller(s) within an area, 
which  is  pre-defined  to  meet  operational  requirements."
"13.1.6i  The appropriate ERTMS/ETCS RBC should be informed when a Train emergency call 
is initiated."
"13.2.2.1 A Railway emergency call shall be able to be initiated by using a simple MMI action    
(eg a single MMI action for the Cab and Operational radios)."
"13.2.2.2 A connection of Railway emergency priority (see section 10.2) shall be established to a    
pre-determined set of receiving mobiles and controller(s)."
"13.2.2.3 If the system is not able to connect the call, the system shall automatically keep trying    
to connect the call for 30 seconds."
"13.2.2.3i During this period the user shall be provided with an audible and visual indication 
that the system is trying to connect the call."
"13.2.2.3ii  After  the  30  second  period,  if  the  connection  was  unsuccessful,  the  system  shall 
provide another audible and visual indication that it was unable to connect the call."
"13.2.2.4 An audible indication of 5 seconds (to be confirmed by trials) shall be provided to    
originating and receiving users that the emergency function has been activated."
"13.2.2.7 In the event that a train enters the affected area after the warning stage is complete, the    
same audible and visual indications shall be provided."
"13.2.3.1 A speech connection shall be established immediately following the warning tone, to    
allow the originator of the emergency call, to give information concerning the nature of 
the emergency."
"13.2.3.1i Speech should be possible to allow a controller receiving the warning tone to give 
information."
"13.2.3.2 Additionally,  speech  should  be  possible  to  allow  other  mobile  users  receiving  the    
warning tone to give information."
"13.2.3.3 The information shall be received by the same set of users who received the warning    
tone."
"13.2.4.2 If the radio moves out of the area whilst the emergency call is in progress, an audible    
and visual indication of the loss of the call shall be provided to the user."
"13.3.1     Authorised EIRENE mobiles shall be able to receive a Railway emergency call at any 
time while the mobile is powered up."
"13.3.2     For  Railway  emergency  calls  initiated  by  a  mobile,  the  controllers  display  will 
indicate:"
"the functional identity of the originating mobile, which includes the following:"

"the coach number of the leading cab, if neither a train number nor an engine  number is available."
"13.4.1     For post-incident analysis, it is important that the origination and reception of Railway 
emergency calls by mobiles is confirmed by a message sent to a ground-based central 
location (and also recorded in the on-train recording device)."

control user access to facilities and features in the mobile while it is being used for 
shunting communications."
"14.1.2     There  is  a  requirement  to  regulate  the  membership  of  shunting  groups  to  prevent 
uncontrolled membership."
"14.1.3     During specific shunting operations where the driver is not able to see the way ahead 
and where he is therefore relying on information from another shunting member, a 
link assurance signal is needed to provide reassurance during silent periods that the 
radio link is still established."
"This signal is also employed to provide reassurance that 
this other shunting member is not incapacitated."
"14.2.1     The shunting call shall be a group call and shall have Railway operation priority (see 
section 10.2)."

following two operating modes by a maintenance function: (M)"
Mode 1: the member is required to continuously press the link assurance signal  button in order to transmit the link assurance signal;
Mode 2: the member is required to switch on the link assurance signal and then  periodically press a button in order to transmit the link assurance signal (failure to  do so shall result in the deactivation of the link assurance signal after a predefined  period has elapsed).
"14.2.9     The link assurance signal shall be used to provide an audible indication to all group 
members."

"14.4.1     The link assurance signal is a means to provide end-to-end confirmation between users 
that a voice communication link remains intact."
"This facility is required principally for 
the safe conduct of pushing manoeuvres to assure continuing availability of the radio 
channel while a shunting worker is guiding a train driver."
"The  tone  shall  be  of  one  second  duration,  followed  by  an  interval  of  two 
seconds."
"14.4.3     In order to fulfil the requirements of some railways, it should be possible to provide an 
alternative means of link assurance indication."
"14.4.4     This means will consist of an additional safety device (external to the radio system) 
interposed between the Cab radio and the loudspeaker with the purpose of muting the 
continuous link assurance signal for the drivers convenience."

"Its purpose is to keep all of the user’s passwords, data, email accounts, usernames and URLs stored in a very
secure, encrypted database, protected by a Master Password."
The system is very small so it can be easily transferred from one computer to another.
It provides several functionalities on the already encrypted data and the new ones to be inserted.
"The database produced, is protected by a Master Password only known by
its inventor with no backup if lost."
· When writing this document it was inherited that all requirements have the same priority.
It describes in detail all that KeePass needs to work properly and with safety.
"Then follow user classes and characteristics, operating environments that KeePass supports as well as design and implementation constraints."
KeePass Password Safe is a small system that can be easily transferred from computer to computer by a simple USB stick.
Its purpose is to solve a problem that really bothers many people today when they have to choose from memorizing a lot of passwords to be secure or to use every time the same one so they won’t forget it but risk be found out by others.
"So it provides you a very secure, encrypted database where you can keep inside all your passwords, usernames, email accounts, URLs, notes without any risk for others to find them."
That is because KeePass Password Safe can lock every database with only one Master Password and/or key file.
Not even by you and that is because there is no recovery password or back door.
"http://sourceforge.net/projects/keepass/
In this website you can find out more about the project and discuss any questions in the forums."
"You can go back and look at previous releases, code and problems that have been solved."
"http://keepass.info/
This is project’s official website where you can find links to all above and also find features
available for downloading such as language translations and plug-ins."
KeePass consists of a database which contains data for one or more users.
Each user’s data are divided into groups and subgroups so that they are organized in a form that serves right the user.
Every user has a unique Master Key which can be simple or composite and its combination opens uniquely the database.
"If lost there
is no recovery."
"Groups and subgroups contain entries with usernames, passwords URLs etc that can be sent or copied to websites, application and accounts."
"In the diagram below there are the main components of the system, subsystem interconnections and external interfaces to help you understand the main idea of KeePass."
The database can be opened and closed whenever user wants it.
The user also can print all data in order to keep them with him even when a computer is not available.
Also the user can search the database using key words through a search engine provided with the software.
"Last but not least, the database can be imported and/or exported from/to the Internet."
The feature of searching can be applied in just one group and not in the whole database if wanted.
"Change Language
At KeePass website there are available language translations that can be downloaded and applied easily."
"Auto-Type
The user can select a sequence of keypresses that KeePass will be able to perform and send them to any window or browser."
"Command Line Options
The user can pass a file path in the command line in order for KeePass to open this file at startup."
"Composite Master Key
To open a database you must use all key sources such as password, key file and/or Windows account details that were used when the Master Key was created."
So the user cannot use a combination of them to unlock the database.
"Configuration
This feature is used to explain how KeePass store its configuration and where."
"· Import/Export
KeePass can support importing data from CSV files, Code Wallet, Password Safe and
Personal Vault."
"Integration
KeePass uses Global Hot Key to restore KeePass main window and Limit to single instance option to run only one instance of KeePass at a time."
"Password Generator
There are available generations based on character sets and based on patterns the first for generating random passwords and the second for creating passwords which require specific patterns."
"There is also available generating passwords that follow rules which are
determined further down on this document."
Then there are security-reducing options which reduce the security of the passwords they are applied to.
"Finally there are configuring
settings of automatically generated passwords for new entries so that a random password will automatically be created by KeePass when a new entry is wanted."
"Secure Edit Controls
KeePass offers the ability for passwords and data to be appeared behind asterisks when the user wants it."
"When this option is turned on, secure edit controls stronger than the ones of Windows are protecting your data and no one can access them, see them or steal them."
"This
feature can be used for generating one time passwords so that there won’t be any chance, for anyone to access e.g."
your bank account even if he finds out that password.
That is because when the password is entered one time it becomes useless.
TANs can be added using the TANs wizard.
"URL Field
The URL field supports various special protocols and placeholders and can be used for
Standard capabilities where URL field can execute valid URLs for which a protocol handler is defined."
"In addition to that, KeePass supports all registered protocols that Internet Explorer supports."
"Also, placeholders can be used that will be automatically replaced when the URL is executed."
"Using Stored Passwords
Passwords that are stored in the database can be copied to website accounts and applications with security and without retyping them again."
This feature is turned on and locks the database when minimized.
So to unlock it the Master Key is required again.
"Advanced end users: users that are familiar with programming and can personalize their database by creating auto-types, using command line options and generally can use features and maybe expand their use by adding more functions."
System administrators: administrators working on computers that support a lot of accounts and personal data for other users.
Using KeePass the administrator can save all data with no risk of leak to third persons.
Science/Research Telecommunications: for organizing data that have to do with lots of people and applications
Industry: for one-time passwords that can be used for testing controls or for expired entries to gain access in particular systems and programs.
"KeePass should run on Operating Systems: WINE, 32-bit MS Windows (95/98), 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP), All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP),Win2K, WinXP, Microsoft Windows Server 2003."
"The user interfaces used are: NET/Mono, Win32 (MS Windows)
All new releases contain Filename Architecture Type
KeePass-1.x-Setup.exe i386 .exe (32-bit Windows)
KeePass-1.x-Src.zip Platform-Independent Source .zip
KeePass-1.x.zip i386 .zip
and release notes witch describe what has changed and what has been added."
Nothing more than these is required for a fully functional KeePass.
"copy to an application, account, and website) it remains in the memory for only 10 seconds."
After 10 seconds pass there is nothing to paste and you have to recopy again.
That provides security in a case a password is copied and not pasted anywhere so no one can find it out by pasting later.
"Language Requirements in KeePass Password Safe:
Not in all translations translated help files and tutorials are available."
"In order to keep the user’s data fully protected, 2 very secure algorithms are used:
Cipher Block Size Key Size Advanced Encryption Standard (AES / Rijndael) 128 bits 256 bits Twofish 128 bits 256 bits In both algorithms every time the user saves a database, a random 128-bit initialization vector is generated."
"All the bytes needed for the Initialization Vector, the master key salt, etc are generated via pseudorandom sources: current tick count, performance counter, system date/time, mouse cursor position, memory status, active window focus handles, window message stack, process heap status, process startup information and several system information structures."
"When the KeePass is active, all passwords are stored encrypted in process memory so in order for them to be completely safe the ARC4 encryption algorithm is used, using a random 12 bytes long key."
"A KeePass Internet shortcut which take the user in the system’s official website where are available downloads, translations, plug-ins and extensions."
System features are organized by use cases and functional hierarchy so that the main functions of the system will be understandable.
It is the first thing a user must do to begin using KeePass.
Its main function is the determination of the master password that will unlock the database from now on
A message is appeared which prompts him to enter a password or key file
This feature allows the user to open an existing database.
When choosing to open a database a user is transferred to his documents where he navigates to find the database he wants.
"When the database is found, the master password is wanted so that the database will be unlocked."
Once this is done the user is free to access his data.
Folder selected must be of type the database can read and that is “name”.kdb
This feature allows the user to save any changes or updates he has performed to his database.
"When a database is opened, the user can access his passwords, organize them into new
groups and subgroups, delete and add entries and so much more."
"But when it is time for the database to close or during his working on the database, he can save the changes made."
User continues working after he saves the database
User wants to exit KeePass
A message is appeared asking if he wants to save the database
A message is appeared asking if he wants to save the database before locking
Databases must have different names or else the previews one will be replace if selected
This feature allows user to print a selection of data that are stored in the database.
"While working on the database, the user has the option to print data from his database."
"When this happens, a list of data types that can be printed are shown and the user can select the data to be printed."
"More specifically fields that can be selected for printing are: Backup entries, which contain entries in the back up group, password groups, group tree, title, username, password, URL, notes, creation time, last access, last modification, expires, icon, UUID and attachment."
"The list of options opens with checked the fields: password groups, title, user name, password, URL, notes"
There must be entries in the database in order for them to be printed
This feature allows user to search for keywords in his database.
This is very useful when the user needs to find out very quickly which password is required in one account or what username he has put on another account.
It is not necessary to write in the search field all characters.
By writing just one character the database will present all data which contains it or are related with it.
"User types a password, user name, URL, word of notes, title or group that exist in the database"
"For example if user types “abc” and abc is part of a password and of a username, both entries must be shown"
This feature is used to keep data organized in categories for easier access.
When creating a group/subgroup the user must select a name and then he can add entries into it.
User opens KeePass and selects to add new group/subgroup
A message is appeared “Add a name for the group/subgroup”
A subgroup cannot be created when no group is selected
This feature allows user to change a name given to a group/subgroup.
"When user wants to change a group or subgroup’s name he has the ability to do that by
modifying it."
A message is appeared “Add a name for the group/subgroup”
This feature allows the user to delete a group/subgroup.
When a user wants to delete an existing group/subgroup he can do this by selecting Delete group/subgroup from the edit menu.
"In order for that to happen, he must have chosen first a group/subgroup."
User selects to delete the group/subgroup
A message is appeared to confirm the delete
This feature allows user to find data into a specific group/subgroup.
The user selects a group/subgroup and then he chooses “find in this group” from file menu.
Then a window appears which prompts the user to write a sequence of characters (letters and numbers) from one character to 200 (or more).
"After that a menu of options to choose from appears and the user can select to search for: title, user name, password, URL, notes, group name."
User opens KeePass and selects to find something in a selected group/subgroup
User types the word to search for
User selects the fields which will be searched
User leaves all search in boxes unchecked
User leaves all search in boxes unchecked
The user can add a new entry on the database by clicking add entry on the main menu.
"When he does this, a window opens which is actually a form."
In this form the user completes the fields he wants.
"He can fill in fields like: group where the entry will be added, title, user name, password, repeat password, URL, notes, expiration date and attachment file."
Not all fields are required for an entry to be created.
User opens KeePass and selects to add an entry
"User fills in the form, as many fields as he wants, from 1 to 9"
A message appears “the repeated password must be identical with the password
An entry must belong to a group to be created
When the password field is completed the repeat password field must be completed
This feature allows the user to change or modify an existing entry.
The user can modify the context of an entry he already has added.
"In order for that to happen, the user must select an entry first."
"When he does this, the form he filled in when he created or last modified the entry open."
User opens KeePass and selects to view/edit an existing entry
User changes the fields he wants in the form
A message appears “the repeated password must be identical with the password
ìAn entry must be selected to be viewed or modified
"ìWhen the password field is changed the repeat password field must be
Changed and be identical with password field"
When this is done the new entry is added in the same group were the first was.
An entry must be selected before it is duplicated
This feature allows the user to delete an existing entry
When this is done a message appears and informs the user that if he deletes the entry he won’t be able to restore it back.
User opens KeePass and selects to delete an existing entry
A message appears “Are you sure you want to delete the selected entry?”
REQ-17: An entry must be selected to be deleted
This feature allows user to choose one of the language translations that are available in KeePass
The user can select between a number of translations that are available at KeePass website.
"There are available translations in Arabic, Brazilian, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese
(Simplified and Traditional), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French,
Galician, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Lithuanian,
Macedonian, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak,
Spanish, Swedish, Turkish and Ukrainian."
"All the user has to do is to select change
language from the view menu and then the language he wants."
If he already has download languages packets he can choose one of them.
If he wants another language pack he can select get more language.
Doing this he will be transferred at KeePass website and choose the language he wants for downloading.
"User opens KeePass and selects to change language from the view menu
2."
"The user selects a language to load from the list that appears
3."
"A message appears that informs user that the installation has been done and in order for the changes to take place KeePass must be restarted
4."
"KeePass asks to save any changes that may have been made in the database and restarts
6."
"User unlocks the database using the Master Password
7."
The database appears translated in the new language
The browser opens in KeePass website were translations are located
User selects a language he wants
"REQ-18: An internet connection and a browser are required in order to download new language translations
For the following features, use cases are not included"
This feature allows user to define a sequence of keypresses which KeePass will automatically perform.
The user defines the sequences which can be sent to any other open window like browsers or login accounts.
If a sequence is more than a line it cannot be used and in case of two sequences in one note’s field only the first one is used.
There are 3 methods to invoke auto-type.
The first method is to use the context menu command and perform auto-type while the entry is selected.
The second method is to select an entry and press Ctrl+V
The third method is to use the system-wide auto-type hot key so that KeePass can search all entries in the database for matching sequences.
"If two auto-types are referred in one note field, only the first is used"
This feature allows user to pass a file patch in the command line so that KeePass will open it immediately after start up.
"In case a space is found in the path, it must be enclosed into quotes"
This feature is a composition of master password and key files and all its composites are required so that the database can be unlocked.
A master key is a password the user creates.
"Once a master key is created for a database, it is always required."
"In case the user forgets it, the database can never be opened again by any way."
A key file is a file that locks the database.
The database opens when this file is present.
"If the file is lost and there are no copies of it, all data are gone forever and database never unlocks again."
"If a master password is required to unlock the database, the database doesn’t
open unless the password is entered"
"If a key file is required to unlock the database, the database doesn’t open unless the key file is present"
"If there is a composite key, both master password and key file are required"
There is no backdoor or key that unlocks all databases
This feature gives the ability to user to import/export files from/to database.
There are available plug-ins which add more import capabilities and formats and those are: File format CSV and File format XML.
"Despite that, almost all support exporting to CSV or XML files."
REQ-30: File formats only specify a low-level layout of stored data
This feature allows switching back from an application to KeePass.
"In case of multiple
databases running of KeePass the global hot key restores the window which was opened first of all."
The password generator creates random passwords every time an entry is created.
This feature can be disabled if user wants it by selecting 0 as password length in the password generator dialog.
According to restriction rules that are applied every time.
TANs can be passwords that provide security because they can never be used for more than once time.
"When TAN are created, they appear as typical entries which in the field title contain “TAN” so that KeePass will know it’s a TAN."
"When a TAN is used, its expiration time is set to that current time and the entry expires automatically."
"When a TAN is used, it expires automatically and can never be used again."
"When a function is performed like adding, editing or deleting, the active window is the one performing the action."
At this time the main database window is inactive and cannot be accessed unless the current active window is closed.
KeePass as referred previously uses NET/Mono and Win32 (MS Windows) interfaces.
"When a password is copied, it remains on memory for only 10 seconds."
"If in the meanwhile it is not pasted anywhere, it must be copied again."
"That happens so that if user copies a password and not paste it anywhere, the password cannot be found by anyone later."
"When a USB which contains the database is removed from a computer while changes haven’t been completely saved, the database is damaged and cannot be opened."
"In case the user forgets or loses the Master Password, the repair functionality won’t help."
"In case the header of the database, which is the first few bytes, is corrupted, again the repair functionality won’t help."
"To avoid this kind of situations, backups can be done regularly."
KeePass is a small and light project so it does not need to be installed.
All it takes is unpacking from the Zip package.
"KeePass is a project that once uninstalled from a computer, leaves no trace behind."
So there is no way passwords and other data in the database to be found later.

"This document describes the requirements specification (SRS) for the software infrastructure (or
      product) that enables the internetworking of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) through peering,
      henceforth termed as ‘CDN peering’, and provides an overall description of it."
"It presents a means for
      distinct CDNs to coordinate and cooperate with other CDNs, by investigating and developing (a)
      models for effective internetworking between CDNs though peering; (b) protocols for service
      delivery in a cooperative environment of CDNs; (c) some concrete examples (technology trends) that
      exhibits the notion of content networking; and (d) policies for autonomic management of service level
      through resource negotiation in an on-demand basis."
"When writing this SRS for CDN peering, the following terminologies are used:"
"Web server (WS): The container of content comprising of two layersoverlay, which is a collection of Web service host (e.g."
"Apache, Tomcat), Service Level Agreement (SLA)- allocator, and policy agent, and core, which refers to the underlying hardware infrastructure."
PM: A set of mediator-specific rules for interaction and negotiation.
"This document is written for the researchers, software developers, advanced practitioners,
      documentation writers, and users involved in CDN domain to initiation an open discussion for
      exploring development opportunities regarding the internetworking between CDNs."
"Section 2
      discusses the steps that are to be undertaken to “bring-up” or “cease” an internetworking arrangement
      between CDNs."
"In the next section, system features with their functional requirements are presented
      to highlight the major services provided by the intended product."
"Finally, this specification is concluded with the reference documents on
      which this document is based on."
"The final product enabling CDN peering assists in coordinated and cooperative content delivery via
      internetworking among distinct CDNs to allow providers to rapidly “scale-out” to meet both flash
      crowds and anticipated increases in demand, and remove the need for a single CDN to provision
      resources."
"An ad-hoc or planned peering of CDNs requires fundamental research to be undertaken to
      address the core problems of measuring and disseminating load information, performing request
      assignment and redirection, enabling content replication and determining appropriate compensation
      among participants on a geographically distributed “Internet” scale."
"In contrast to a single CDN, for
      which these issues are deeply interrelated and co-dependent, the main thrust for the final product
      enabling CDN peering is to consider them in a coordinated and cooperative manner among many
      peered CDNs, whilst satisfying the complex multi-dimensional constraints placed on each individual
      provider."
"Each provider must ensure that their individual SLAs are met when serving content for its
      own customers to end users, while meeting any obligations it has made when participating in a group
      of many providers."
The performance models to demonstrate the effects of peering and to predict user perceived performance [4].
"CDN peering allows different CDN providers to share resources in order to provide larger scale
      and/or reach to each participant than they could not achieve otherwise."
"It is formed by a set of
      autonomous CDNs, which cooperate through a mechanism that provides facilities and infrastructure
      for cooperation in order to virtualize multiple providers."
"It is expected that an effective peering
      arrangement between CDNs would require multiple steps to occur."
Peering allows a particular CDN to achieve larger scale/reach through resource sharing with other CDN(s).
"flash crowds, when the (primary) CDN realizes that it cannot handle a part of the workload on its Web Servers (WSs)."
Negotiated relationship: The controlling interest of a CDN to interconnect with other CDNs leads to the creation of a negotiated relationship.
"In the business domain, this relationship (most likely) would take the form of a legal document which describes the expected level of services from the involving parties such as storage requirements, the required rate of transfer, cost of services; the expected duration of receiving service, penalties for service violations, and other preconditions such as the initiating CDN’s preference to gain resources at a particular region."
"Therefore, divergent policies are allowed that specify the information that can be shared during interaction through providing a certain level of visibility to preserve privacy."
"Resource discovery: Once the initiating CDN identifies its roles and activities through the created negotiated relationships for coordination and cooperation between CDNs, the next step is to choose potential CDNs to peer with."
The mediator instance passes the service requirements to the local PA to discover external resources from peers.
"The PA performs the resource discovery process through predicting performance of the peers, working around issues of separate administration and limited information sharing among enlisted CDNs."
If there are any preexisting peering arrangements (for a long term scenario) then these will be returned at this point.
CDN peering protocols: The next step is to configure the ‘CDN peering’ protocols at the conduit of the respective CDNs in order to technically support the terms and policies implicitly specified through the negotiated relationships.
"This step includes advertising the configurations (topology aspects, geographical proximity, capability, performance, etc.)"
"On establishment of a peering arrangement, these protocols also allow participating CDNs to exchange information regarding the content availability and assists to redirect requests to an optimal peer."
Request-redirection in a peering arrangement depends on the content distribution and request-routing policies (specified in the CDN peering protocols) associated with the content as well as the specific algorithms and methods used for directing these requests.
"Operational management: When the primary CDN acquires sufficient resources from the peers to meet its SLA with the customer, the new peering arrangement becomes operational."
"Once a peering arrangement is established, all participating parties cooperate in the execution of common goal(s)."
Peering also enables the CDNs to exchange accounting information to perform billing based on the negotiated relationships.
Disband or re-arrangement: An existing peering arrangement may need to either disband or re-arrange itself (within the scope of the negotiated relationships) if any of the following conditions hold: (a) the circumstances under which the arrangement was formed no longer hold; (b) peering is no longer beneficial for the participating CDNs; (c) an existing peering arrangement needs to be expanded further in order to deal with additional load; or (d) participating CDNs are not meeting their agreed upon contributions.
Development and validation of peering and manage the complexity of content delivery across Web servers of multiple CDNs that scale across the globe.
Assists an existing CDN to alleviate congestions by detecting and handling short-term load spikes (i.e.
The policy agent is responsible (in conjunction with the mediator) for determining which resources can be delegated and under what conditions (policies) delegation is permitted.
"to satisfy both local and delegated SLAs, and ensures that the terms of the SLAs are enforced."
It works in conjunction with its local PA to discover external resources and to negotiate with other CDNs.
"Once a peering arrangement is established, it controls what portion of the Web traffic (i.e."
"end-user requests) is redirected to the Web servers of the peering CDNs, which content is replicated there, how the replication decision is taken, and which replication policies are being used."
It ensures that the participating entities are able to adapt to changing circumstances (agility) and are able to achieve their objectives in a dynamic and uncertain environment (resilience)
"It helps in discovering local resources through enabling the Web servers of CDN providers to register and publish their resource, service and policy details."
"When a new peering arrangement is established, an instance of the service registry is created that encapsulates all local and delegated external CDN resources."
Content replication is performed using a cooperative pull-based approach where participating CDNs assist each others in serving data.
"Thus, content replication is featured through extending it to participating servers from the peers in a given peering arrangement, subject to the available resources they contribute"
"Load distribution is performed by measuring the load information and disseminating it within individual CDNs and amongst other CDNs using a hierarchical approach, where current bandwidth and resource usage of web servers in a CDN is reported to the CDN gateway (i.e."
"Therefore, endusers can be assigned via DNS (by the peering agents of participating CDNs updating their DNS records regularly) and also via redirection at the CDN gateway when appropriate."
"Explicit members include the primary CDN, which is the initiator of a peering
      relationship, and any peering CDNs who cooperate for resource sharing."
"For instance, a short-term peering arrangement is to be automated to react within a tight time
      frameas it is unlikely that a human directed negotiation would occur quickly enough to satisfy the
      evolved niche."
"On the other hand, establishment of a long-term peering arrangement calls for a
      human-directed agent to ensure that any resulting decisions comply with participating CDNs’
      strategic goals."
"Users can also be classified because of the preferential treatment that they may receive
      due to the policy that pertains to a particular provider’s business logic."
"Moreover, individual users (or
      a group of users) can have dynamic QoS requirements depending on the situations that will result in
      “customized” content delivery."
"Thus, users (or class of users) can be differentiated based on userdefined
      QoS specifications while accessing the service."
"prototype system) enabling CDN peering is expected to be deployed it in a realworld
      test bed such as PlanetLab for global testing, observations, and for performance evaluation."
"In
      this regard, existing Web services technologies will be studied in detail to examine the feasibility of
      leveraging them."
"A modular
      implementation approach would be useful to perform testing on modules at different stages to ensure
      correct implementation."
"It is anticipated that a cryptographically secure auction-based framework will
      be used to assist content replication among peered CDNs to allow incentives for all participants."
"Request
      assignment and redirection could predominantly rely on DNS-level end-user assignment combined
      with a rudimentary request assignment policy such as weighted round-robin or least-loaded-first,
      which updates the DNS records to point to the most appropriate replica server of the peers."
"Due
      to the proprietary nature of existing CDNs, limited information about response time or service cost is
      typically available from individual CDNs, and load balancing control is retained by an individual
      provider within its own Web servers."
"It is anticipated that the
      values used in a CDN peering implementation model are likely to be based on heuristics."
"Along with the software product, a user manual would be written to help people understand the
      working methodology and usage of the developed prototype system."
"It would be written for nontechnical
      individuals and the level of content or terminology would differ considerably from, for
      example, a System Administration Guide, which is more detailed and complex."
"The user manual
      would follow common user documentation styles capturing purpose and scope of the product along
      with key system features and operations; step-by-step instructions for using the system including
      conventions, messaging structures, quick references, tips for errors and malfunctions; pointers to
      reference documents; and glossary of terms."
"In
      particular, the design and implementation approach of MotusNet could be helpful to draw a clear
      guideline for developing the intended prototype."
"Being a major important section of
      the SRS, this section is expected to go through iterative improvement to make the most logical sense
      for the intended product."
"Service registration is triggered when either one of the following occurs: (a) resources
          are available as a provider starts operating; (b) previously registered resource
          information needs to be updated; (c) available local resource information is required in
          the event of traffic surges; and (d) local and delegated external resource information is
          to be encapsulated in an SR instance included in an established peering arrangement."
"These resources
          could be provisioned and reserved to satisfy SLAs."
"If it is a new resource, its service information is registered in the SR with a new resource ID."
"If a resource fails, its service information is removed from SR and the resource ID counter is decremented."
Mediator: Receives initiation request from WS to trigger peering.
"It is invoked when a (primary) CDN realizes that it cannot handle a part of the
          workload on its WS(s)."
"Exceptional circumstances such as flash crowds have occurred to place unanticipated
          load on CDN WSs."
An initialization request is sent to the mediator to trigger peering.
"If the user requests experience service timeout (threshold), initiation request is
          cancelled."
"On receipt of the initialization request to trigger peering, the mediator of the primary CDN invokes
        negotiation."
"PR: Sends policy information for establishing negotiated relationships
          PA: Receives service requirements from the mediator."
The mediator instance obtains resource and access information from the SR and policy information from PR to establish negotiation.
"If the service requirements are acceptable according to the provider’s policy, mediator passes it to the local PA."
"If the user requests can not be accepted according the provider policies, service
          requirements are not passed to the local PA."
Mediator works in conjunction with the PA to establish negotiation.
"If any peering policies exist, they are returned to establish long-term peering arrangement."
"If sufficient resources are acquired, a peering arrangement is established"
"Else, mediator re-evaluates service requirements and sends to the local PA to perform re-negotiation."
"If the user requests can not be accepted according the provider policies, service
          requirements are not passed to the local PA."
There is procedure to perform short-term negotiation.
"Once policies are negotiated and a peering arrangement is established, PAs interact
            each other in the execution of common goal(s)."
"Once a peering arrangement is established, the initiating primary CDN through its local PA advertise configuration information to technically support the negotiated relationships between enlisted CDNs."
PAs exchange content availability and load information to identify an optimal peer to handle user requests.
PAs exchange accounting information to perform billing based on negotiated relationships.
"If a peered CDN provider refuses to accept user requests, a given peering arrangement
            ceases."
"There could be circumstances under which a given peering arrangement may need to disband or rearranges
        itself."
A given peering arrangement is currently in operation and peers are cooperating for effective content delivery.
"for which any peer is unable to honor the negotiated relationships, a given peering arrangement is not disband or re-arranged and SLA conditions are bypassed."
Policies are in place to perform renegotiation for problem resolution.
Policies are in place to perform renegotiation for problem resolution.
"For user interface design, common GUI standards will be followed along with
    the presence of keyboard shortcuts, error message display standards etc., and standard buttons and
    functions (i.e."
"Details of the user interface design are intended to be
    documented in a separate user interface specification."
"As mentioned earlier, the intended product to exploit existing Web service technologies to leverage
      existing infrastructures through building an overlay."
"From a technical point of view,
      TCP/IP will be used as the transport protocol, where each CDN server establishes a TCP connection
      to the network elements using a well-known port number."
"Interaction among
      surrogates will be performed using HTTP or FTP."
"The review reflected that WP2 presents with its deliverable D2.1 “an ambitious, high quality vision,
    reflected in a 4 stage maturity model, which is well argued.” The general feedback received for this
    document was positive, especially highlighting various insightful remarks."
"On the other hand the
    review process has generated some criticism which will be addressed by WP2 in future works."
"The
    following description responds to these comments and criticism by arguing how and where revisions
    and updates of the work presented in this deliverable will be implemented in subsequent results of WP
    2."
"The term “framework” thereby seems
        to be misleading and will be replaced by a more suitable expression."
"Responding to criticism from the review, strong
        interconnections will be added to the subsequent deliverable D2.2, which will give a more
        detailed description of the organisational, semantic, technical and legal specifications of the
        VCD concept."
"In D2.2., the requirements stated in D 2.1 will be reconsidered and transformed
        into a tabular collection of functional and non-functional requirements grouped for different
        components of the overall VCD concept (see subsequent contents of D 2.2)"
"The pre-VCD mapping pilot (subsequently called European VCD service), which is a tool that
        informs an economic operator about what evidences s/he has to provide in order to comply
        with the selection and exclusion criteria set out in a call for tender or contract notice of a
        contracting authority in another country: This service will comprise of an ontology, an ontology
        manager and a VCD interaction tool, which does the reasoning (mapping) and provides the
        interface for a user to query the ontology for the mapping."
"The VCD schema specification comprised of a logical data model and a physical
        representation in XML will be the standard format to ensure interoperable VCD package
        implementation."
"The VCD services which will compile VCD packages in five pilot member states (after the
        PEPPOL enlargement procedure, three new pilots have been added to WP 2): These VCD
        services will implement a number of services to query and collect evidences from different
        issuing bodies and to pack the individual evidences into a full VCD package thereby also
        extracting certain metadata and context specific data which will facilitate machine-readability
        and quick evaluation of a VCD package."
"Likewise, organisational specifications will detail the processes of interaction between users,
        the scenarios for the production pilots, test and evaluation guidelines as well as business
        models of pilots, and governance and maintenance structures to ensure long-term
        sustainability."
"However, the
    current European public eProcurement infrastructure is inappropriate because it is characterized by a
    high market fragmentation and a lack of interoperability."
"Hence, a major objective of the European
    Commission is to enable European-wide eProcurement across borders by creating common principles
    and technical solutions that are applied within all Member States."
"eProcurement requires efforts to be
    done by public administrations, in particular to exploit new technologies for interoperability that enable
    easy information accessibility, improving the availability of pan-European services and interaction
    among citizens and businesses (European_Dynamics_S_A 2004)."
"Governments are the largest buyer in the European Union which purchase at a level of approximately
    15-20% of GDP (Ministerial_Declaration 2005)."
"Common standards for electronic data
    exchange seem to be a key element for companies to participate in public eProcurement."
"The Manchester ministerial declaration of 24 November 2005 defines the target that
    ((Ministerial_Declaration 2005) p.4): “By 2010 all public administrations across Europe will have the
    capability of carrying out 100% of their procurement electronically, where legally permissible, thus
    creating a fairer and more transparent market for all companies independent of a company’s size or
    location within the single market."
"Over the period 2006-2010 Member States
    will focus their efforts on delivering those high impact services in Europe which will contribute most to
    the achievement of the Lisbon Agenda.”
    It is expected that an interoperable eProcurement infrastructure ensures equal treatment and nondiscrimination
    and that it facilitates fairer and more effective competition in the European market by
    enabling suppliers to compete in an open and transparent way."
"However, current eProcurement
    infrastructures are inappropriate to reach this ambitious aim since these are characterized by a high
    market fragmentation."
"Systems are either centrally oriented
    or designed to reflect federated systems demands."
"The lack of a unified eProcurement terminology is a major barrier which
    affects the possibility of a smooth collaboration between Member States and their eProcurement
    systems (Commission_of_the_European_Communitites 2004)."
"Legal, technical and organisational
    barriers prevent the development of a common Procurement infrastructure and are one of the greatest
    challenges to be solved by politics, governments, ICT industry and research
    (European_Dynamics_S_A 2004)."
"PEPPOL2 aims at setting up pan-European pilot solutions that
    conjointly exist with national infrastructures."
"Among the building blocks the PEPPOL consortium develops, the Virtual Company Dossier (VCD)
    focuses on an interoperable solution which contains the documents required from economic operators
    to evidence their qualification as well as qualitative selection or exclusion according to the directive
    2004/18/EC."
"A VCD will facilitate electronic Tendering by providing cross-border data and document solution that
      contains the necessary attestations and certificates typically required in eTendering."
"When a
      contracting authority publishes a contract notice, it shall include the selection, qualification and nonexclusion
      criteria."
"The economic operators have to submit evidence and proof in respect of these
      criteria."
"Hence, during the preparation of the tender an economic operator needs to collect the
      respective evidences (i.e."
"The overall aims and expectations of a virtual company dossier solution as set out in the description of
      work can be described as follows:"
"The VCD will support any authorised entities (economic operator, intermediary, contracting
          authority or IT service such as an eTendering system) in creating an electronic information
          package consisting of the required documentation, evidences, proof, attestations, certificates,
          declarations and metadata."
"In order to create the VCD, an implemented IT system will have to collect certificates and
          attestations from existing registries."
"It also enables the economic operator to add self-declarations
          or other documents of formal qualification."
"Furthermore, the VCD solution supports economic operators in producing a VCD and in enabling
          them to submit the required documentation (assembled as an information package) to any
          contracting authority in Europe."
"In the same way the VCD as an implemented IT system will enable contracting authorities or their
          eTendering systems to interpret and accept the documentation submitted by the economic
          operator."
"Therefore the contracting authority must either specify the documentation that has to be submitted
          by economic operator or the criteria of qualitative selection and exclusion that have to be fulfilled
          by the economic operator."
"For all parties (economic operator, intermediary, contracting authority, issuing bodies) it will be of
          high importance that the VCD Service Providers are trustworthy; this implies that the services are
          precise, up-to-date, available and reliable."
"The status quo concerning the tendering process, observed in the European countries of this work
      package, is depicted in a generic status-quo procedure as shown in Figure 1."
"The procedure can be described as follows: A Contracting Authority prepares a call for tender
      based on a set of documents, usually consisting of a) the publication of a contract notice b) the tender
      contract documentation c) the (technical) specifications, d) additional documents."
"The contract notice
      is produced and transmitted to the official gazette such as the Tenders Electronic Daily (TED) when
      due."
"It should be noted that for public tenders above a certain threshold, the publication in the Official
      Journal of the European Union (TED) is mandatory."
"An Economic Operator can use means such as the TED system, existing tendering platforms or
      official national gazettes to search for contract notices (2) and to retrieve the relevant information
      about active tenders (3)."
"The mandatory publication of contract notices in TED is a means to ensure transparency for
      public procurement throughout Europe and to enable a well functioning inner market."
"If an Economic Operator decides to participate in a public tender across border, the appropriate
      selection and exclusion criteria have to be evaluated."
"This means that the Economic Operator has to
      match these criteria set out in the contract notice of another country with the evidences (attestations,
      statements and certificates) of his or her own country in order to prove compliance (4)."
in the country where the Economic Operator is established (5).
"The step of retrieving proofs of suitability and non-exclusion and collecting documents for the receiving
      entities becomes a necessary task and may take place at different times."
"In some European Member
      State countries the “self-declaration” (a statement issued by the Economic Operator) is adopted to
      claim an initial suitability for applying and attending a tender."
"In this case, Economic Operators may
      retrieve their proofs of suitability only at a later stage if necessary at all."
"In this
      case, accredited official translators, lawyers or notaries have to issue such legally attested translations
      of evidences."
The following flows of documents have to be considered specifically:
documents that cannot be generated in the target language by the originating authority;
documents that must be accessed by the contracting authority from the official source.
"In the long-run the VCD should be able to adequately fulfil the contracting
        authorities’ need to prove suitability and non-exclusion of economic operators according to certain
        criteria while reducing the burden of proof for the economic operator."
"This requires a paradigm shift
        towards electronic exchange of evidence and a next generation of attestations and certificates that are
        currently just barely available in electronic form."
"The creation of uniform infrastructure in this
        heterogeneous domain will take some time as several different environments and stakeholders need
        to be involved, and change may not be enforceable to all of them."
"In order to reach these goals we propose an approach with different stages of maturity that may be
        applied dependent on the readiness for the individual Member State."
"The aim is to support basic
        interoperability and exchange of documents on the lower maturity levels and leading towards direct
        electronic exchange of evidence in the higher maturity levels."
In the following we will introduce the staged maturity model for the VCD as depicted in Figure 2.
"Every Member State should develop a solution that meets
        the demands of basic interoperability."
"Basic interoperability can thereby be defined as a state where
        organisational transparency of cross-border tendering requirements is established (stage 1- pre-VCD
        mapping tool)."
"The efforts and expenses to develop a solution that ensures basic interoperability ought
        to be manageable and affordable.Member States, who would like to advance their solution towards a higher level of interoperability, can
        do so by adopting subsequent VCD maturity levels."
"An
        eTendering system and a contracting authority must be able to interpret a VCD package assembled by
        a VCD application regardless of the implementation stage of the VCD application and the eTendering
        system."
"Figure 2 illustrates the staged maturity model of the VCD that has been designed to show the
        different stages of implementation and development."
"It is
        therefore necessary to ensure national transparency by gathering national requirements on certificates
        and qualification documents."
"The first implementation level (stage 1) is dependent upon these national
        requirements and will define a basic semantic interoperability model that supports the mutual
        recognition of certificates and qualification documents (pre-VCD mapping tool)."
"The next step then is to define the structure of a VCD by adding several types of (meta)data into it
        (e.g."
"and to build an application that is
        able to compile VCDs and enabling economic operators to submit this information electronically to
        contracting authorities (Stage 2)."
"Stage 3 includes one of the most critical parts of a VCD which consist of making the evidences
        contained in a VCD comparable with regard to their contents to enable automated processing and
        understanding of its contents across borders (stage 3 – VCD advanced package)."
"Stage 4 (VCD networked package) will then provide a sophisticated method for changing the overall
        process from push to pull."
"Instead a contracting authority can
        request those documents on demand from a database (pull) at national service provider who hosts
        VCD services, or directly from the very registration authority."
"The model as presented in Figure 2 is further described in the following
        subsection with the purpose to detail the various stages."
"For a future maturity path of a VCD Service one has to take into consideration the most important
        points of the vision and the goals of a VCD, which are:"
Compiling a VCD Package is a service supporting Economic Operators and/or Contracting Authorities in procurement procedures
"The real benefit could be gained when the VCD Package (which may be seen as a container for
            documents – structured or unstructured – and additional information) is complete and accurate."
"The following preconditions and assumptions that define the context of VCD Services and VCD
        Packages should be taken into consideration:"
"Criteria for qualification and selection are in accordance with the Directives 2004/18/EC4,5(public
            procurement) and 2004/17/EC6 (utilities), and are used to map among national requirements."
"Documents may be machine readable (digital copies, unstructured contents) or machine
            interpretable (structured content, thus can be processed by machines)"
"An attestation is made up of one (or more) document(s) including machine interpretable data that
            describes these attestation (e.g."
VCD can provide direct access to attestation if there is a mandatory rule for it in law.
"VCD systems provide single point of contact to attestations from public sources and information
            necessary to prove conformance to a given call for tender."
A VCD Package may be linked to exactly one call for tender thus it is tender specific
"In accordance to the above mentioned major visions and requirements two important dimensions are
        to be considered in order to assess the benefits of a VCD Service and a VCD Package (cf."
"The different levels of support address both the maturity of the service and the maturity of the VCD
          package, where the latter corresponds to the semantic richness of the provided information."
"On the
          Peppol/WP2 strategy there is explicit interest to have parallel increments on both sides, assuming that
          the semantic enrichment of the VCD package requires a corresponding enriched supporting system."
"Which attestations, certificates or statements provide evidence for which criteria (making up the
              mapping), including the possibility of using self-declarations;"
issuing authority) the evidences are provided.
"On this level of support the VCD rule set is defined as a reference model which is manually or semiautomatically
              consulted by the economic operator and/or the contracting authority."
"Compilation Support: Helps the responsible player (in most cases the economic operator) to compile
              a VCD Package according to the defined definitions/regulations/rule set/model by means of a
              specialized VCD Service (not necessarily implying an IT-System):"
"The individual evidences are enriched with additional descriptions/metadata (adding structural
              data of evidence);"
"The VCD Package as a whole contains additional metadata, describing the VCD package itself
              (VCD package data, e.g."
"Evidences are provided in a structured and machine interpretable form, at least those that can be
              easily transformed in such representation;"
"The contracting authority may control whether or not the evidences prove the required criteria (as
              opposed to the level of compilation support, where one only could check if the VCD is complete
              and the attestations are valid)."
"A VCD Package will show its full potential when all the requested evidences (all that are necessary to
          prove all requested criteria) are contained in it."
"From
          a pragmatic point of view, it seems reasonable to focus on a subset of evidences in a first step and to
          complete the VCD Package later on."
"It is also reasonable to define a default package list that has to
          be provided in most public tenders by economic operators independently of particular criteria
          mentioned by the “Call for Tender”."
"Develop possibilities to map and add other documents (self declarations or statements from banks
              etc.)"
"The criteria for qualitative selection and non-exclusion as defined in the Directive 2004/18/EC are the
        common ground for building a cross border VCD service."
"The figure below shows the relevant criteria
        as defined in Articles 45-50 as these are regarded the most common ground when mapping any
        national criteria to the European ones."
"Mapping evidences to the criteria stated in Articles 45 and 46 may be regarded as sufficient for a first
        step since these can be further described within sub criteria and related atomic criteria ."
Atomic criteria: has been convicted of an offence concerning his professional conduct by a judgement which has the force of res judicata
"European mapping, economic operator specific: The second step provides a mapping of national
          attestations which evidence criteria defined by Directive 2004/18/EC8, and with a particular focus
          on Articles 45 and 46."
"Extended European criteria set and mapping: The third step completes the information support by
          adding all the other criteria in Articles 47 to 50 of the Directive 2004/18/EC on a high level and
          where possible on sub criteria/atomic criteria level."
"The pre-VCD mapping tool introduces a procedure to collect information about the evidences for
      specific Call for Tenders."
"Thereby the Status quo procedure of section 1.2 remains unchanged, except
      that a pre-VCD mapping exists which is implemented and provided through a European service
      provider9 (see Figure 5)."
"The mapping tool provides information to the economic operator on which
      national attestations of his or her country fulfill the criteria set by the procuring agency in the respective
      country (steps 4, 5)."
"To fulfill a first precondition for a VCD package as introduced in Stages 2 and beyond, the pre-VCD
      mapping tool is the proposed function and the process that allows for its execution."
"For every domain we suppose to get a
      representation of a national index which provides an overview of national criteria demanded in public
      procurement, and how these are evidenced (i.e."
"This index also indicates structural data of evidence for example the issuer of the individual
      attestations or statements and the service it may activate for public or reserved access."
"In this respect,
      the European selection and exclusion criteria, which are derived from the European Directive
      2004/18/EC, can be considered the reference criteria, while the national criteria which are the basis for
      individual public tenders in respective countries are considered the local criteria."
"Figure 6 depicts the
      general taxonomy for the pre-VCD mapping concept, while Figure 7 shows a detailed taxonomy of the
      concept “evidence”."
"With this taxonomy, it is possible to map the fact that evidences can either be
      provided by the candidate himself (e.g."
"self-declaration, declaration on oath, solemn statement) or
      specific issuers as certified authorities and/or [authorized] third parties."
"Furthermore, evidences may be of different type such as statements, attestations or certificates, as
      indicated in Figure 7."
"Overall, the pre-VCD mapping tool supports in the proof of compliance of evidences of one country to
      the requested selection and exclusion criteria of another country via a mapping to the European
      exclusion and selection criteria."
"The respective retrieval of attestations and statements (6) and the subsequent steps (7-8) remain the
      ones as described in the status-quo description of section 1.2 above."
"As stated in the introduction, it can be seen as a minimum
        requirement for all Member States participating in the PEPPOL VCD work package."
"At this stage, a semantic model is introduced that supports guidance in applying the relevant
        community rules on mutual recognition of evidences (e.g."
"a provision of alternative means for evidencing criteria, when foreign economic operators areconsidered;"
"An economic operator participating in a tender of a foreign country can quite easily understand the
            requirements (what criteria have to be fulfilled) and decide which are the best national attestations
            (self declarations included) to prove the criteria requested by the contracting authority."
"The contracting authority can check through the same mapping mechanism whether the submitted
            attestations express fulfilment with the relevant criteria or requirements."
"The contracting authority can activate a direct access to attestations that are exposed through
            open services, including the international cross-linking."
"A contracting authority sends a notification on a Call for Tender to a Publication body that publishes
        the call."
"The Call for Tender contains the definition of evidences and the specific criteria on qualitative
        selection and exclusion that are relevant to this particular call."
"If an economic operator decides to participate in a particular Call for Tender he can directly retrieve
        relevant information about evidences and criteria by using the information published in the Call for
        Tender."
"In cases below threshold or in the cases where the public notice is partial, the economic
        operator might send a direct request to the contracting authority in order to retrieve the required
        information."
"Having the relevant criteria in place the economic operator will be enabled to get a
        mapping to the national attestations that refer to those criteria via the pre-VCD mapping tool."
"Thesame process can be performed by the contracting authority in order to check whether the submitted
        attestations adequately fulfil certain criteria asked for."
"The pre-condition to the above flow of events is represented by the formal representation of imposed
        criteria, in particular for the qualification segments affecting, the technical, the financial and the quality
        criteria (as per directive 2004/18/EC_Arts."
"Such formal representation has to be addressed
        along with the setting of the tool."
"Besides the use of the pre-VCD mapping in actual tendering and procurement procedures, a “system”
        needs to be maintained which implements the mapping of European and national laws, and the
        agreements of mutual recognition among Member States (see use-case diagram depicted in Figure 9)."
"Major Feature: pre-VCD mapping tool
        The first feature to be addressed in this stage is the mapping between the criteria of qualitative
        selection and exclusion derived from Articles 45-50 of the Directive 2004/18/EC and the national
        attestations giving evidence to these criteria."
"To handle the large set of ruling articles, which may
        especially vary in the national implementations (articles 47-50), arts 45 and 46 shall get a higher
        priority for a smooth implementation at first hand, while arts 47 to 50 will only be selectively
        implemented on the basis of specific and deeper analysis in the PEPPOL pilot contexts."
"Due to the
        diversity and variability of evidences according to Art 51, this criterion will receive least priority in the
        implementations (if at all taken into consideration)."
"This mapping includes at first hand an overview and transparency among national evidences and
        European criteria as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7 above, including information about who issues
        specific evidence."
"Further on, this mapping needs to be implemented in the pre-VCD mapping tool as
        depicted in the use-case diagram in Figure 9, i.e."
"a list of criteria to be matched is submitted to the
        entity performing the mapping."
"Using the underlying technology, the mapping is done and its results,
        consisting of a list of the attestations giving evidence to the demanded criteria, can be transferred to a
        requester in case of a public tender."
"These criteria should be derived directly from
          09/11/2009 – version 1.1 (approved by EC)
          the Articles 45-50 of the Directive 2004/18/EC in order to ensure employment in Pan-European public
          procurement procedures."
"The right granularity and consistency of criteria will be important to ensure
          legitimacy and to retrieve adequate mapping results."
"Thus the criteria may have to be iteratively redefined
          according to the results given by specific mappings."
"Superset of evidences: The formal representation will become necessary as a reference data set
              for the mapping operations showing the relationship between all attestations."
"Subset of evidences: The input for the current function (mapping) comes from specific “Calls for
              Tenders” which therewith represent tender-specific requirements."
"National requirements of qualitative selection and exclusion for qualitative selection and exclusion
          have to adequately represent the national legal conditions."
"They have to be formulated in a way that
          they can be mapped to common European criteria for qualitative selection and exclusion mentioned by
          the Articles 45-50."
"In a first step, all member states do have to establish a mapping of the criteria defined in the relevant
          EU directive 2004/18/EC to the national attestations giving evidence to these criteria."
"To ensure a
          degree of comparability and reliability among the results, the mapping should be based on a common
          template."
"For the overall activity it will be important to have the appropriate legal support in order to
          ensure legitimacy of mappings."
"A template that ensures comparable and reliable mappings between criteria for qualitative
              selection and exclusion and national attestations MUST be defined."
"The resulting template has to be computable by machines and readable by humans allowing the
              assembly of VCD packages through manual and/or automated operations."
"In order to achieve trust and an agreement on the mutual recognition of qualification documents as
          demanded in the directive, all artefacts and mapping results that relate to the mapping of evidence
          have to be approved from a legal point of view."
"Compliances to national and European conditions
          must be ensured in particular for the definition of a standard representation of common criteria of
          qualitative selection and exclusion, the definition of a mapping template and the mapping between
          national attestations and the common criteria for qualitative selection and exclusion."
"Contracting authorities approaching the tool have to assess the compatibility of the “mapping
              template” with their inspection procedures and code of practice."
"The European Commission as well as the National Bodies have to update the mapping model in
              case the legal grounds change or the mapping of European Criteria to national Evidences and
              issuing bodies change."
"Hence, adoption and approval procedures have to be defined and enacted in order to install the
              pre-VCD mapping and pre-VCD mapping tool as an official mapping model."
"Precondition: The adoption of the model requires a parallel effort from the legal side to compare
              whether the provisions of existing NPPAs can get a harmonization through the referencing to the
              EU directive."
"This is a major requirement to drive the action of contracting authorities that have
              strict obligations to follow while performing in a tendering procedure."
Specify an infrastructure and facility that provides the mapping service
"The commonly approved national mappings have to be made accessible to the different stakeholders
          as especially economic operators, contracting authorities and national VCD service providers."
"For that
          purpose, a basic infrastructure or system architecture or a mapping facility has to be defined."
"The
          mapping facility, independent of how such as “system” is actually implemented, has to provide the
          services with regard to the pre-VCD mapping tool"
"In the latter case, one could define that each national system
              only hosts the national mapping or that each one hosts all the different national mappings which
              would make a synchronization of the different systems necessary."
"A decision to deploy either a centralised or a decentralized infrastructure that provides the
              mapping service MUST be made."
"The technical means to provide the
              mapping service has to be defined in dependence on the choice of the pilot solution."
"Another solution could consist of a web-based access to a
              system providing the mapping by querying an underlying database which contains the mapping
              table."
"A more advanced solution would be an automated processing of the mapping according to
              the relevant criteria that therefore have to be specified by the contracting authority in a dedicated
              electronic format."
"In dependence of the choice of infrastructures
              (centralised – decentralized) and the organisation that governs the infrastructure and mapping
              facility it has to be defined who will be responsible to host the mapping facility."
"Define governing model with the necessary status and power to ensure fulfilment of functions like liability, sustainability and maintainability"
"A governing model has to be defined in order to deploy the infrastructure, to maintain its state and
          sustainability over time."
"In this respect the composition, structure and scope of the governing model
          has to be formally defined to ensure fulfilment of functions like liability, sustainability and
          maintainability."
"The dedicated governing model should have the necessary status and power to
          govern its assigned functions."
"Liability: In law a legal liability is a situation in which a person or organisation is financially and
              legally responsible."
"The liability of the organisation that governs infrastructure and mapping facility
              has to be defined in order to ensure trust into the system and particular mapping results?"
The Liability of organisation that governs the infrastructure and mapping facility MUST be defined
The governing model must ensure that the state of the mapping system will be kept over time.
"Therefore the mapping system has to be based on the commonly agreed mapping and no
              changes are allowed without a common agreement."
"Maintainability: The mapping has to be easily maintainable which could be of interest in the case
              of changes of the legal basis on national or European level."
"A formal procedure has to be found
              how changes are applied to the system."
"Moreover an organisation or institution that governs the
              process of change management has to be defined."
A formal procedure to make changes to the system MUST be defined.
"Therefore each national service provider that provides a VCD (stage 2-4) and
          all relevant key other stakeholder such as economic operators, contracting authorities and certifiers
          must be able to retrieve the latest mapping information from the mapping facility."
"In order to derive sufficient mapping information the economic operator has to provide the criteria that
          are relevant to a particular call for tender."
"The overall procedure would be simplified dramatically when
          the relevant criteria for a particular call for tender could be fetched either from a publication body or
          directly from the contracting authority."
"The interaction with either the publication body or the
          communication with the contracting authority therefore has to be further defined."
"The interaction between mapping facility and Publication Body / Contracting Authority SHOULD be
          defined in order to simplify the procedure to retrieve the relevant criteria for a particular Call for
          Tender."
"Attention has to be paid to a number of requirements such as reliability, accessibility, usability,
          maintenance, authenticity, actuality, compliance of mapping to laws and national structures, etc."
"The
          pre-VCD mapping tool has to be accredited by the European Union and the Member States."
The pre-VCD mapping tool is openly accessible for economic operators and contracting authorities etc.
"A powerful search mechanism is implemented to deliver good results when economic operators
              query the pre-VCD mapping tool in order to understand what evidences he can deliver to confer to
              the selection and exclusion criteria set in a public tender in another Member State."
The results are delivered in a format simple to use for the economic operators; e.g.
"a check list of
              evidences he can collect from respective issuing bodies in his country, which fulfil the selection
              criteria and prove the non-conformance with exclusion criteria set by the contracting authority from
              a different Member State."
"The Member States shall agree on a common representation format for the information they
          intend to supply into the knowledge base supporting the tool’s operations."
"The Member States shall supply the information generated from the analysis of the national
              context they represent."
"The Member States need to update the mapping in case of any change within a short time frame
              (e.g."
"The European service provider for the pre-VCD mapping tool has to ensure that European legal
              changes are implemented quickly (e.g."
"The European service provider defines the criteria for a “service contract” to be formally agreed
              with “users”."
"It
        requires that the European criteria and national criteria have to be elaborated and agreed upon by the
        different Member States."
The major advantage and benefits of stage 1 are as follows:
"The major benefit for economic operators lies in the fact that an automatic mapping of criteria to
            national evidences is provided through a pre-VCD mapping tool, thus omitting the need for a
            manual and error-prone selection of appropriate evidences for a particular Call for Tender."
"The
            mapping guarantees that the submitted attestations are mutually recognized if they correspond to
            the mapping information given by the system."
"The mutual recognition implies a formal
            commitment by contracting authorities that take part of the service chain, or alternatively by a legal
            enforcement operated by qualified entities."
"The formal commitment must in turn specify what is
            taken as pure guidance or qualified template."
"The contracting authority can as well use the mapping in order to check if the attestations
            handed in by an economic operator of another country are sufficiently evidencing those selection
            and exclusion criteria defined for the tender."
"Through the pre-VCD mapping model, it will also be possible to identify the major issuing bodies
            of particular evidence."
"Nevertheless this function will not be available for all kinds of attestation
            since there may be too many issuing bodies that provide attestations of the same type (e.g."
"Through the pre-VCD mapping tool, both the economic operator and the contracting authority
            save time and money because they need not to find out by themselves"
"Overall, the pre-VCD mapping tool supports in the proof of compliance of evidences of one country to
            the requested selection and exclusion criteria of another country via a mapping to the European
            exclusion and selection criteria."
"As mentioned in the vision statement, this stage focuses on the preconditions for a VCD package, and
        hence provides only limited functionality."
"A mapping system is introduced, allowing the mapping of
        criteria to national evidences, thus omitting cumbersome manual and potentially error-prone selection
        of attestations/evidences by the economic operator across borders."
"the functions that are not covered
        by this stage:"
"All documents to be transferred to a foreign
            contracting authority still have to be translated by a certified translator into the appropriate target
            language, if requested by the contracting authority."
"In this stage the economic operator is not supported in creating a VCD package that follows a
            common logic."
"The VCD package compilation has to be performed by the economic operator
            himself (it is offered in the next stage of the VCD four-stage-model)."
"There is a quality issue to be addressed concerning the acquisition of data for the knowledge
            base, i.e."
"The contracting authority and economic operator can only retrieve information about the issuing
            bodies of particular evidences when a Member State has specified accredited public issuing
            bodies and recognized private issuing bodies within the national part of the pre-VCD mapping."
"Stage 2 requires the establishment of a national VCD service provider which hosts the VCD system in
        order to provide economic operators with the services necessary to create an early VCD package."
"The national VCD service provider
        operates the VCD system and takes the role of a trusted third party (TTP) whose services can be
        partially trusted by contracting authorities."
"The VCD package relies on a set of automated, semiautomated
        and manual issuing services which are collected by the VCD system."
"Thereby issuing
        services that are automated through a direct access to national issuing bodies are reliable to the
        contracting authority while manual and semi-automated issuing service that have to be provided by the
        economic operator are not under control of the national VCD service provider."
"The VCD system wants
        to ensure completeness of a VCD package by acting as a single-point of contact for the economic
        operator that supports him in creating a VCD package from various sources."
The VCD system in stage 2 will be capable to compile a VCD package from different types of data.
"Stage 2 defines the basic structure of a VCD package by including these types of data that give
        evidence for the suitability of an economic operator."
"Therewith the contracting authority will be enabled
        to check the validity of the evidences contained within the VCD and whether the requested evidence
        adequately represents the fulfilment of the demanded criteria."
"Thereby translation of evidences may
        be still necessary and has to be performed by the economic operator in dependence on national legal
        and organizational requirements because the VCD package does not provide any standardised
        context-specific data which provide common semantics."
"Checks concerning the content of the
        evidences are therewith not possible in this stage, as there is no context specific data available."
"Nevertheless a VCD simple package provides a set of other types of data that are introduced in the list
        below:"
"Structural VCD package data: Data that describes the VCD-Package as a whole, e.g."
Tender specific evidence: Data that describe tender specific aspects e.g.
"Economic operator evidence: Data describing the individual situation of the economic operator
            e.g."
"The use case description of stage 2 contains several sub-diagrams that describe interactions that are
        needed firstly to authenticate to the systems and secondly to create, transport and view a VCD simple
        package."
"The Identity and access management is an official procedure that handles roles for authorisation
          external to the VCD system and involves three actors, the economic operator, an officer and the VCD
          system itself as shown in Figure 11."
"Economic operators have to apply for a VCD account and therefore they have to provide sensitive
          economic operator data (for example by uploading attestations to verify these data)."
"An officer has to verify whether the provided data belongs to the
          economic operator and has to assure its correctness because either the VCD packaging service would
          not work or would deliver incomplete or wrong results."
"After verification the officer creates a VCD
          account where sufficient data about the economic operator is stored."
"In addition, identity and access
          management requires the possibility to delete an account within the VCD system and an official
          procedure to apply for a modification of the VCD account."
"An economic operator can authenticate to
          the VCD system only when the economic operator has sufficient user rights (e.g."
"authorized
          representative of economic operator) provided by identity and access management as shown in Figure
          12."
"The VCD system creates a
          suggestion for compilation according to the results provided by the pre-VCD mapping tool and in turn
          the economic operator can edit and confirm the compilation suggestion that is given by the VCD
          system as shown in Figure 13."
"Evidence and structural evidence data is
          provided by issuing bodies which can submit evidence and structural evidence data to the VCD
          system via an interface."
"An important remark therefore is that economic operators can take the role of
          an issuing body by submitting for example candidate statements, manually collected evidence or
          translations of evidence."
"The interface to submit evidence is defined through a service definition that
          allows adding specific structural evidence data that belongs to that evidence."
"The collection of
          evidence is finalized when all required evidences are submitted and this requires waiting for those
          evidences that have to be provided manually or semi-automatically."
"The VCD system can now compile 
          the VCD package and creates a set of structural VCD package data that belong to the compilation
          process."
"The economic operator can submit the VCD simple package to the contraction authority by using the
          VCD transportation system which is part of the PEPPOL infrastructure."
"For using the VCD
          transportation system of WP8, both economic operators and contracting authorities have to
          authenticate to have access."
"An important remark hereby is the usage of procurement platforms
          where bids are typically uploaded according to a given Call for Tender."
"The transportation system of
          WP8 used by the VCD should be able to provide a possibility to send the VCD package directly to the
          contracting authority either by utilizing the upload functionality of a procurement platform or by directly
          sending the VCD to the contracting authority by using other means provided by the transportation
          system or typically used by the contracting authority."
"It is also important to state that the transportation
          system does not necessarily have to be used by the economic operator."
"The economic operator
          receives a VCD package by the VCD system and it is up to his choice how to submit the VCD package
          to the contracting authority."
"After retrieving the VCD package from economic operators, contracting authorities may have to
          authenticate to the VCD viewing system in order to view the VCD package."
"In contrast economic
          operators do not have to authenticate to the VCD viewing system because they are taking the role of
          an owner of the VCD package."
"The VCD viewing system has to fulfil certain sub-functionalities for displaying the different kinds of
          data that are contained within a VCD package."
"the TED ID to which the VCD package is related to),"
"This subsection lists the major features, requirements and quality attributes that are significant for a
        VCD simple package."
"Feature: Application for VCD account
          This feature describes the necessary functionalities and interfaces that are needed to apply for a VCD account."
"Identity and access management MUST provide an interface to submit sensitive economic

An officer has to create a VCD account for the economic operator.
"Identity and access management MUST provide a functionality that enables the economic
             operator to receive his log-in data."
"The authentication within identity and access management SHOULD provide a single-sign on

          instance that is addressing a particular Call for Tender."
"The VCD system MUST provide a functionality to check through identity and access management
              whether an economic operator has sufficient user rights to access his account."
The VCD system MUST provide an interface where the economic operator can provide nonsensitive economic operator data.
The VCD system MUST provide an interface where tender-specific data can be either fetched from or be provided through (e.g.
The VCD system MUST provide an interface where the economic operator can request the creation of a VCD package.
The VCD system MUST have an interface to receive and process the information (mapping of evidence) provided by the pre-VCD mapping tool.
"The VCD system MUST provide a functionality that suggests a possible compilation of the VCD to
             the economic operator according to the tender-specific criteria."
"The VCD system MUST provide a functionality where the economic operator can decide which
              particular attestation services should be invoked and collected."
"The VCD system MUST provide a functionality that displays the attestation services that cannot
              be invoked automatically and that have to be manually added by the economic operator."
"The VCD system must provide a functionality to request attestations that can be collected
              automatically via an issuing body."
"The VCD system MUST have an interface/technical access to retrieve attestations that can be
              automatically retrieved from issuing bodies."
"The VCD system MUST have a functionality to extract structural data of evidence from
              attestations that can be retrieved automatically."
"The VCD system MUST have an interface to submit/upload evidence that have to be provided
              manually by the economic operator."
"The VCD system MUST provide an interface where an economic operator can add structural data
              of evidence that belong to specific evidence."
"The VCD system SHOULD provide an interface where a translator/economic operator can submit
              certified translations to specific evidence."
"The VCD system MUST provide and interface where the economic operator can initiate the
              compilation process."
"The VCD system MUST provide a functionality to notify the economic operator when the
              compilation process is finished."
The national VCD service provider that hosts the system must have the status of a trusted entity.
The compilation suggestion that is given to the economic operator by the VCD system MUST be reliable with regard to fulfilment of tender-specific requirements.
"Feature: Authentication to VCD transportation system
          This feature describes the necessary functionalities and interfaces to authenticate to the VCD
          transportation system."
"The VCD transportation system MUST provide a functionality that enables both parties involved,
              contracting authorities and economic operators, to authenticate to the VCD transportation system
              before using it."
"The VCD transportation system MUST provide a functionality that enables the economic operator
              to find an electronic address of a contracting authority for receiving VCD packages."
The VCD transportation system MUST have an interface to connect to it in order to submit the VCD package to a contracting authority.
The VCD transportation system MUST provide a functionality that supports the economic operator in submitting the VCD package to a contracting authority.
"The VCD transportation system SHOULD provide a functionality that supports the economic
              operator in submitting the VCD package to a contracting authorities’ procurement platform where
              the tender/bid has to be placed."
"The transportation system MUST provide an interface that enables contracting authorities to
              receive a VCD."
The choice of how to submit the VCD package to the contracting authority MUST be the one that is preferred by the economic operator.
Beside the transportation system (WP8) the economic operator SHOULD be able to use other electronic channels for submitting a VCD package to the contracting authority.
It MUST be clarified which possibilities exist to utilize the infrastructure for submitting a VCD package directly to procurement platforms (e.g.
The transportation system MUST ensure that the VCD package is being delivered to the contracting authority
The transport of a VCD package MUST ensure that the package has not been altered or modified during transportation or validation.
A VCD will carry a unique identifier and information about security and quality enhancing policies used by the certified VCD Service Provider when compiling the file.
"Feature: Authentication to VCD viewing system
          This feature describes the necessary functionalities and interfaces to authenticate to the VCD viewing
          system."
The VCD viewing system MUST provide a functionality to authenticate contracting authorities to view the data contained within a VCD package.
reverse engineering) to develop a standard representation of the different types of data SHOULD be defined.
"The major aim of stage 2 is to draft logical systems that enable economic operators to create simple
        VCD packages and to submit them to contracting authorities."
"Thereby stage 2 focuses on the
        necessary different logical systems that either provide major functionalities with regard to creating and
        viewing a VCD packages (VCD system) or which support the entire process such as authentication
        (Identity and Access management), transportation (VCD transportations system) or translation (VCD
        translation system)."
"The general assumption of stage 2 is that the former pre-VCD mapping tool (stage
        1) will be utilized as a module that is adequately integrated into the VCD system."
"Stage 2 also introduces the idea of a national VCD service provider which operates the different
        services necessary to create and view a VCD package."
"The national VCD service provider will provide
        a single-point of access to several attestations and issuing services that are electronically available."
"Nevertheless it will be necessary to include other evidences that have to be provided semiautomatically
        or manually by the economic operator."
"It also cannot be guaranteed that each
        evidentiary document required according to the criteria stated in the Call for Tender by the contracting
        authority can be pointed at with a particular mapping results of the pre-VCD mapping tool since some
        evidence diverge too much in their contents and scope."
"In those cases the VCD system will provide
        the possibility to add those documents into the VCD simple package through placeholders which may
        09/11/2009 – version 1.1 (approved by EC)
        have a very generic grounding for mapping defined through an abstract class of documents (e.g."
"When summarizing those points it
        can be generally stated that a VCD at stage 2 and beyond still relies on several manual processes that
        have to be generated by the economic operator and which cannot be automated in short or medium
        term."
"However, a reduced scope of a VCD is necessary in order to provide the possibility to submit a
        VCD that has a sufficient level of completeness."
"Another aim of stage 2 is to differentiate, define and structure the types of data that will constitute a
        VCD package."
"The VCD package
        contains similar structural fields which likewise describe the evidences contained in it in similar
        manner, order and style."
"Having similar structural layout of a VCD it will be easier to understand the
        contents of it and potentially to translated those structural key information from the language of the
        issuer or economic to the language of the contracting authority."
"Nevertheless a translation of the
        contents of evidentiary documents is not focussed at in this stage and has to be provided manually by
        the economic operator through adding translations into the VCD simple package."
"The VCD package only focus on major functions that are necessary to create such a
        package and doesn’t make use of other service that are introduced in the subsequent phases such as,
        recompiling an existing VCD package, usage of context-specific data and merging VCD packages of
        different economic operators into a single one."
"The recompilation of existing VCD packages increases
        the maintainability of a VCD for the economic operator by for example indicating which evidence has
        to be replaced by a new one and which evidence has to be additionally provided in case preparing a
        bid for a different Call for Tender."
"The usage of context-specific data thereby is an important precondition
        since these data can provide real-time information about the status of contents of the VCD
        which is needed in terms of making update proposals."
"Also the merging of different VCD packages
        into a single unit to be used when consortia which prepare a bid as a multi-party group is not
        addressed in stage 2."
Updating an existing VCD package whenever one or more evidences are outdated.
"This could be
            done by checking whether evidences are outdated or not, retrieving the outdated evidences again
            and creating a new VCD package, which then contains the newly obtained evidences and those
            evidences from the original VCD, which are still valid."
"This use case contains the necessary steps an economic operator performs to create a new VCD
          advanced package."
"This use case is similar to the use case “Create VCD simple package” of stage 2
          but adds the necessary functionality regarding context specific data and merging existing VCD
          packages into the new VCD advanced package."
"This use case contains the necessary steps an economic operator performs to re-compile an existing
          VCD package into a new VCD advanced package."
"a consortium, contractor-subcontractor-relationships) into one VCD package, the economic
          operator has to be able to provide these VCD packages to the VCD system."
"The stage 2-collection process for evidence and structural evidence data has to be extended to
          include the collection and processing of context specific data."
"It is important to understand that context
          specific data cannot be automatically extracted from unstructured data as scanned copies or text
          documents as this could lead to incorrect results due to the non-deterministic behaviours of such
          extraction mechanisms (OCR, etc)."
"Automated context specific data provision: extraction of data from structured evidence artefacts
              which are machine interpretable (e.g."
"XML) and which have been generated by an IT-system, if
              the structure is consistent with an agreed upon schema."
"This approach requires an
              additional level of trust into the national VCD service provider acting as Trusted Third party as he
              will be responsible for the correctness of the context specific data itself and not just only for the
              compliance of the processes, which are executed by the VCD services."
"In order to merge VCD packages of several economic operators, acting as a single economic operator
          (e.g."
"a consortium, contractor-subcontractor-relationships) into one VCD package, the VCD system
          has to be able to consider data from several existing VCD packages in the compilation process."
"In order to be able to compile a VCD advanced package, the VCD compilation process must be
          extended to be able to process data from existing VCD packages of other economic operators and to
          process the context specific data that are included."
"This chapter contains the major features, requirements and quality attributes which are derived from
        the vision statement and the use-case descriptions of stage 3 and which extend the major features,
        requirements and quality attributes of a stage 2 VCD simple package."
"The benefit of using context specific data is
          to avoid the necessity to read through the original version or a translated version of an evidence in
          order to obtain the information which is necessary to decide, whether a criterion is satisfied or not and
          thereby having a structured overview of the important key data or information of the evidences
          contained in a VCD."
"This overview – the data representation – can be implemented either language
          independent or in multiple languages, so there is no need to translate the evidence any more if it is
          sufficiently described through context specific data."
"The enhanced and automated documents’
          readability that comes from the context specific data must be compared to the local legal provisions
          and document checking practice adopted by contracting authorities."
"A VCD system MUST provide functionality to collect and process context specific data for evidence that has to be provided manually or semi-automatically by the issuing body, by the economic operator or any trusted third party."
A VCD system MUST provide functionality to collect and process context specific data for evidence that has to be provided automatically by the issuing body.
A VCD system MUST provide IT-interfaces to issuing bodies which provide evidences in machine interpretable format.
A VCD system MUST interact with the issuing bodies which provide evidences in machine interpretable format through IT-interfaces.
A VCD system MUST provide a user interface to the issuing body to provide context specific data for an evidence in a structured form (e.g.
The VCD system MUST provide a functionality to validate the provided context specific data during the submission process of context specific data to ensure the data is consistent with the VCD advanced package schema.
Interfaces MUST be defined to retrieve context specific data from issuing bodies either automatically or semi-automatically.
Interfaces SHOULD be defined that enable national VCD service providers to approve context specific data if they decide to take the role of a trusted third party.
he rule set allowing for a Stage 3 mapping among concepts expressed by the “context specific data” MUST be defined.
Any VCD advanced package MUST follow a common standard schema of context specific data that summarize and structure major information contained within context specific evidences.
Evidences that have a simple structure and limited variety of contents MUST be included into the common standard schema first.
a Balance sheet can have several values but an easy representation could be the fulfilment of certain ranges for example below 1 Million / from 1 Million to 10 / …).
A semantic definition of each element/class of the common standard schema of context specific data MUST be created and has to ensure a common understanding.
A semantic definition of each element/class of the common standard schema of context specific data MUST ensure that these data is mutually recognized as replacement of the official translation of an evidences included.
A method and agreement procedure to develop a common standard schema of context specific data MUST be defined.
which context specific data is required from contracting authorities or under which circumstances would they would replace certified translation of evidence by context specific data).
"The VCD creation service of stage 2 VCD simple package has to be improved in order to include the
          functionalities for considering context specific data and VCD merging."
A VCD system MUST provide a user-interface to the economic operator to initiate the creation of a VCD advanced package.
A VCD system MUST provide a user-interface to the economic operator to provide existing VCD packages of other economic operators when specific disclosure options have been activated.
"A VCD system MUST provide a functionality to check, whether the tender specific data of existing VCD packages are consistent with the tender specific data of other VCD packages."
"A VCD system MUST provide functionality to compile the data which result from the evidence
              collection process and the data provided by the economic operator in the VCD advanced package
              creation."
"The types of data which have to be compiled into a VCD advanced package are
              therefore:"
"In stage 3, the functionality of the VCD system has to be extended in order to provide a VCD recompilation
          functionality."
"Re-compiling a VCD package means using evidence data from an existing
          VCD package, validating which of the evidences are outdated, retrieving actual versions of the outdated
          evidences an creating a new VCD package which contains the not-outdated evidences from the
          original VCD package and the newly obtained evidences."
"The re-compilation process considers only
          those evidences which are necessary in be compliant to the criteria which have to be addressed in the
          new VCD package."
A VCD system MUST provide a user-interface to the economic operator to initiate the recompilation of an existing VCD package into a VCD advanced package.
Re-compiling a VCD simple package into a VCD advanced package MUST be possible
Re-compiling a VCD advanced package into a VCD advanced package MUST be possible
"Providing context specific data leads to an
        additional support for the economic operator and for the contracting authority addressing the need to
        evaluate the contents of evidences across borders."
"An economic operator is able to verify the
        correctness of the provided context specific data."
"The provision of context specific data avoids the need for translating certain
        evidences that are available in electronic format and allow the description of its contents using the
        common standard schema of context specific data."
"An important point to ensure the acceptance of this approach is to establish or expand the trust in
        national VCD services cross borders:"
"In stage 1 contracting authorities are required to trust the provided evidences, issuing bodies, translators and the correctness of the international mapping"
In stage 2 contracting authorities are required to trust the national VCD service providers as they are responsible for the compilation of VCD packages containing valid (not outdated) evidences or other evidences which are suitable to give evidence for the required criteria
In stage 3 contracting authorities are required to expand their trust into the national VCD service providers as they are responsible for the compilation of VCD packages containing context specific data which augment the evidence content.
"On the side of the VCD service providers, composing a VCD package is a more or less complex task depending on national country abilities, willingness, etc."
"Stage 4 introduces a set of ideas and possibilities how further value can be added to a Virtual
        Company Dossier."
"The key idea of Stage 4 is to create a network for the VCD that allows retrieving
        attestations in a more flexible way."
"The Virtual Company Dossier than consists of
        some references to attestation services which mandate a contracting authority to obtain information
        directly."
"A direct exchange between trusted attestation services and a contracting authority would provide
        many opportunities with regard to an increase of the actuality of evidence, to lower the transaction
        costs of the parties involved and to reduce the time to create a VCD."
"Nevertheless such direct
        exchange is very difficult to implement technically because a lot of entities and attestation services
        have to be federated."
"Finally a semantic pre-condition would be that evidence
        is provided in a common electronic format that allows an automated transformation into the requestor’s
        target language."
"In order to avoid some of the above mentioned complexity we propose some first steps that might help
        to combine the ideas of a VCD and a federated network in medium term allowing further
        improvements of a VCD."
"To avoid political and technical questions with regard to federated networks,
        the access to attestations services should be done indirectly through the national VCD service
        provider."
"We suggest that a national VCD service provider uses a temporary storage to hold the
        attestations instead of compiling them directly into a VCD."
"The VCD then only consists of a number of
        flags that denote an evidence as well as structural data of evidence and context specific data plus a
        reference to retrieve the attestation on demand at the time of awarding."
"Therefore it would be
        important that the evidence requested is valid at the time of awarding or when the call for tender is
        closed."
"Such model of indirect exchange would also make it easier for a
        national VCD service to establish an official list of approved economic operators in accordance with
        Article 52 (1) of Directive 2004/18/EC."
"The national VCD service provider could use the information
        within its storage to maintain such lists."
"Evidence that is sufficiently described through context specific
        data could then for example be automatically validated by a national VCD service provider by putting
        validation values into a VCD."
"Stage 4 therewith improves the level of support for the economic operator since the need and burden
        to present specific attestations to the contracting authority will be eliminated."
"Stage 4 therewith fulfils
        the paradigm shift where a contracting authority only asks for the fulfilment of certain criteria and not
        for the delivery of specific evidence."
"Stage 4 introduces the ""on-demand"" idea
        which allows retrieving evidence directly from the national VCD service provider on individual basis."
"In
        order to ensure the level of completeness, the VCD network package needs to be extended stepwise
        by including evidences which are sufficiently described through agreed and standardised contextspecific
        data and structural data of evidence (and which can easily be validated by the national VCD
        service provider when he accredits economic operators according to Article 52)."
"We propose the
        following major building blocks to establish a VCD networked package:"
"The
            compiled VCD network package only contains both data types and provides references to retrieve
            attestations when necessary (i.e."
"The VCD contains references in the meaning of
            processing instructions for the contracting authority to retrieve the requested attestations on
            individual basis at the time of awarding."
"The reference or processing instruction includes a
            mechanism to grant access rights to the contracting authority in order to retrieve these attestations
            within a certain period of time."
"When the National VCD Service Provider receives a
            valid request at the time of awarding from a contracting authority mandated by the economic
            operator he delivers the requested evidence to the contracting authority."
"Evidences (and in particular those that
            are sufficiently described through context specific data) could be validated by a national VCD
            service provider by putting validation values into a VCD."
"Stage 4 does not contain a modelled use case diagram that clarifies the system interaction and a
      detailed description of requirements because it mainly relies on the functions introduced in the
      previous stages and there are no pilots yet for this stage."
"Functions in
      round brackets ( ) are new to this use case:
      The economic operator requests a VCD on the basis of stages 1, 2 and 3 at the National Service
      Provider."
"The National Service Provider starts the VCD creation process by requesting attestations
      from Trusted Attestation Services that are connected to context specific networks."
"Trusted Attestation
      Services provide requested attestations to a local database or repository that is owned by the National
      VCD Service Provider (store attestation)."
"The VCD system enables the economic operator to mandate
      the contracting authority to access his attestations within the VCD system if the attestations are
      sufficiently described through context specific data (mandate to request attestation through VCD
      specific reference) and the VCD system creates a specific reference into the VCD itself (set reference
      to attestation to VCD)."
"When all attestations are compiled by the VCD system the economic operator can submit its VCD to
      the contracting authority."
"The contracting authority can now request attestations through the reference
      that is specified in the VCD (request attestation on individual basis)."
"The VCD System checks whether
      the contracting authority has sufficient access rights and has been mandated by the economic
      operator to retrieve that attestation (check access rights)."
"Afterwards the VCD system delivers the
      attestation to the contracting authority (retrieve attestation) or informs the economic about a request
      that cannot be handled adequately (conflict resolution)."
"The economic operator than may have to
      provide an additional translation to the contracting authority within a certain period of time."
"This chapter contains the major feature, requirements and quality attributes which are derived from the
       vision statement and the use-case description of stage 4 and which extend the features, requirements
       and quality attributes of the previous stages."
The VCD system MUST provide functionality and an interface to the economic operator that enables him to mandate a certain contracting authority to request attestations on demand.
The VCD system MUST detect which attestations can be used by this feature (e.g.
they have to be sufficiently described through context specific data and structural data of evidence).
The VCD system MUST provide a functionality that enables National VCD Service Providers to store attestations.
The VCD system MUST ensure that a contracting authority is able to request attestations via the provided reference (including time-restrictions).
"The functionality for referencing to attestations within the VCD MUST be implemented, either VCD-specific or contracting authority-specific, in order to approve whether the contracting authority has sufficient rights for requesting the attestations."
The VCD system MUST provide a functionally to check whether a contracting authority has sufficient rights and has been mandated by the economic operator to retrieve attestations.
The VCD system MUST provide a functionality and an interface that enables contracting authorities to retrieve the attestation from the storage.
The VCD system MUST ensure that the attestation that is requested by the contracting authority is still valid at the time of awarding or when the Call for Tender is closed.
The VCD system MUST provide a functionality that initiates a conflict resolution process between economic operator and contracting authority if errors occur or when certain attestation or a translation cannot be delivered on demand.
The VCD system SHOULD provide a functionality to approve attestations through validation data and to make this approval visible within a VCD networked package when a National VCD Service provider takes the role of a national validation point in accordance with Article 52 (1) of Directive 2004/18/EC and EFTA EEA Committee decision 68/2006.
There MUST be an access policy that is issued by the economic operator that mandates a contracting authority to request attestation from the national VCD service provider on demand.
This may include creating contracting authority specific or VCD specific references in order to identify a mandate that has been given by the economic operator to this contracting authority for retrieving attestation or even updates on it.
National and local political commitments and service-level agreements MUST ensure that consensuses on roles and responsibilities are built with regard to this solution and in particular the National Service Providers who delivers attestations on demand.
"There MUST be a service-level agreement between the parties involved (Economic Operators, Contracting authorities, National Service Providers, and Trusted Attestation Service) about the response time of a delivery of attestations and data availability."
"There MUST be a service-level agreement between the parties involved (Economic Operators, Contracting authorities, National Service Providers, and Trusted Attestation Service) about conflict resolution that describe what to do when errors occur or when attestation or translations cannot be delivered “on demand”."
The attestations where an agreement on context specific formats can be reached most easily SHOULD be included first into the network.
Legal systems MUST ensure that context specific data and validation values have an equivalent value to the provision of conventional / traditional attestations.
The national procurement law MUST ensure that National Service Provider can act as national validation points in accordance with Article 52 (1) of Directive 2004/18/EC for economic operators.
Liability issues of the National Service Providers MUST be clarified when they act as national validation points in accordance with Article 52 (1) of Directive 2004/18/EC for economic operators.
"Stage 4 relies on several functionalities or concepts that have been already addressed and described
      in previous stages."
Stage2: Compiling a VCD from several different kinds of data.
Stage2 and 3: Implementation of direct access to issuing bodies and further description of interfaces to provide structural data of evidence and context specific data.
Stage 3: A semantic standardisation of context specific data that describe the major contents of attestations which have a relatively uniform structure and uniform contents.
For example a balance sheet could be much more easily represented electronically if a specific tender would only demand to fulfil a certain range of capital (e.g.
until 1 Million / from 1 Million to 10 / …) that has to be met by the economic operator.
Stage 3: Possibilities to update a VCD and therewith enabling the national VCD service provider to take the role of a validation point in order to implement Article 52 of directive 2004/18/EC.
This first approach is extremely ambitious but the only way to always access actualised data.
This second approach could be implemented with lower efforts but leads to the situation that the data provided by the VCD package is in the end as actual as the data provided by a VCD package that is compiled using the concept from stage 3.
"Already in 2003, the
    EC has published a working document, the European Interoperability Framework (EIF), where the
    authors defined IOP as “the means by which the interlinking of systems, information and ways of
    working, whether within or between administrations, nationally or across Europe, or with the enterprise
    sector, occurs” ((IDABC 2004), pp."
"The document recalls IOP needs on technical, semantic and
    organizational layer with a rather wide understanding of IOP (IDABC 2004)."
"In late 2008 a draft for a
    revised European Interoperability Framework was published by IDABC extending the requirement for
    IOP to five levels12:
    The aim of this chapter is to draw a picture about the current situation applied in the countries with
    regard to potentially placement of a VCD in the MS according to the European Interoperability
    Framework version 2 (EIF2):"
The legal framework thereby refers to appropriate synchronization of the legislation in the cooperating MS so that electronic data originating in any given MS is accorded to proper legal weight and recognition wherever it needs to be used in other MS.
"This includes rules with regard to tendering, submission and awarding including certificates and attestations that are typically required and their mapping to evidences and exclusion and selection criteria from a legal point of view."
The organizational framework then refers to the processes by which different organizations such as different public administrations collaborate to achieve their mutually agreed eGovernment service-related goals.
"This includes best practices for tendering, submission and awarding derived from activities such as stakeholder analysis and stakeholder questionnaires that have been developed."
"The semantic framework ensures that the precise meaning of exchanged information (concepts, organization, services, etc) is preserved and well understood."
"The use cases of the stages
        above show the actors that are involved and have to be addressed through the organisational
        framework e.g."
"Within the project it will be necessary to manage these different kinds of stakeholders by
        adequately integrating them into the project."
"Thereby it will be of importance to define their specific
        role and their importance for our work package within the lifetime of the project."
"Networks of gathering
        evidences are complex to handle because there are several stakeholders to consider."
"To avoid
        problems of involvement a clear approach of stakeholder analysis is needed."
"WP2 can only provide
        guidance to this since it will be a national responsibility."
"Austria for example has set up a physical
        stakeholder forum that informs key stakeholder in regular time intervals about the results of PEPPOL."
"Next to this the WP2 team of Austria is building up a participation platform13 where latest results are
        presented and can be further discussed within forums and mini surveys."
"Each member state has to
        define its own strategy to involve stakeholders during the lifetime of the project."
"WP2 has developed a
        template for stakeholder management that may provide guidance for this."
"To ensure a wide acceptance of the solutions provided by WP2 among stakeholders we have to
        prevent changes in national procedures and infrastructures but to utilize them as much as possible."
"In
        stages 2, 3 and 4 it will be necessary to establish a national service provider who will take care about
        critical VCD processes and therewith ensure legitimacy, trust and appropriate change management."
"These entities then need to
        be included into a list of recognized private and public issuing bodies which will be an important part
        when defining structural data of evidence (e.g."
"A national VCD
        application may list several different issuing bodies that provide the same attestation."
"However the choice which
        attestation is most appropriate should be left to the economic operator but this decision may be
        supported through displaying these different characteristics."
"If an economic operator for example
        decides to rely on a manual issuing service that cannot be directly invoked by a national service
        provider it is the responsibility of the economic operator to provide this attestation and act as issuing
        body by uploading it to the system of the national service provider in order to create a VCD package."
"National solutions therefore may vary due to freedom of implementing
        national solutions but conformance to key issues should ensure their interoperability."
"A key issue for
        example is the pre-VCD mapping tool and it should be integrated into any national solutions either as
        a module or as interface to query results for the mapping of evidences among member states."
"To
        enable automated information processing on the basis of the pre-VCD mapping tool within national
        solutions additional structured information has to be defined within the Call for Tender that enables the
        retrieval of qualification and selection criteria from contracting authorities."
"A contracting authority
        therefore has to specify a relevant criteria subset within a Call for Tender which can then for example
        be referred to by an economic operator by providing the ID of a Call for Tender to the national solution."
Two phased tendering is not explicitly foreseen by the VCD even if it might be used for this purpose.
"In
        most cases we do not see great efforts for economic operators in two-phased since many countries
        only required the submission of self-declarations."
"None of the above mentioned solutions explicitly requires implementing Article 52 of directive
        2004/18/EC."
"In stages 3 and 4 a higher “level of
        decision making” is promoted and we see especially the provision of context specific data (stage 3)
        and the on demand approach (stage 4) as a pre-conditions that ease the establishment of lists of
        approved economic operators across borders."
"However if there is a country that wishes to enable
        such a proof in the VCD it can be done before but will require several manual efforts."
"The requirements have to be fulfilled or further analysed
        and specified in the project lifetime in order to further draft the organisational framework for a VCD to a
        greater extend."

"Often the VCD
          system will have the possibility to specify the issuing services that are needed to evidence certain

"2009)
          Requirement
          The electronic procurement framework MUST support organizations of any size and industry."
"Description
          WP2 concentrates on pre-awarding issues where requirements and procedures are often strict due to
          principles like equal treatment, non-discrimination, transparency, competition etc."
"Although a VCD
          does not include the offer itself it provides several documents that are of great importance for the
          award of contracts and therewith critical for the success of an economic operator for example in cases
          of disqualification because of late delivery of a VCD."
"To avoid those problems testing of VCD should
          be done by reprocessing historical tenders."
"A national solution will only
          be authorized to operate cross-border when all tests are passed; the testing has to be maintained and
          monitored by the European VCD Service Provider."

The goal is to keep the content available and traceable at any time.
"This chapter describes the semantic framework of work package 2 that comprise solutions for the VCD
        from the data perspective."
"Thereby different data perspectives have to be separated that
        comprise a VCD:"
Structural data of VCD-Package: Data that describe a VCD package
Economic operator data: Data that describe an economic operator
Tender specific data: Data that describe a specific Call for Tender
Structural data of evidence: Data that describe the structure of an attestation
Context specific data: Data that describe the content of an evidence.

        profile that can be interpreted and used by systems based on both UN/CEFACT and UBL."
"A selection of such documents will be included in any VCD; they will be produced by national units
          according to national legislation."
This means that their content of data and information will vary.
This means that the records of these documents need to be tagged for the processing.
"Tagged records, information and data can be processed by independent systems and applications
          only if the constraining tags or metadata are recognized by the different processing parties."
"ISO
          1117919 offers such a methodology that is widely accepted."
"The purpose of ISO/IEC 11179 is to give concrete guidance on the formulation and maintenance of
          discrete data element descriptions and semantic content (metadata) that shall be used to formulate
          data elements in a consistent, standardized manner."
"CEN BII is addressing the convergence between UN/CEFACT and UBL by working out neutral
          descriptions called profiles that are describing business operational units of business functionality, like
          the VCD."
"The CEN BII VCD profile will be a document that can be interpreted and used by systems
          based on both UN/CEFACT and on UBL."
"Hence, the use of ISO 15489 and ISO 11179 leads to
          standardised records and information management that can be automated in existing structures."
PEPPOL WP2 is investigating how to apply ISO 15489 to describe the structure and content of:
"The requirements have to be fulfilled or further analysed and
        specified in the project lifetime in order to further draft the semantic framework for a VCD to a greater
        extend."
"“To run real electronic business transactions without human intervention, semantic interoperability
          must be achieved."
"Outcomes from CEN BII are syntax neutral,
          which means that different syntaxes can be bound to the semantic requirements for the documents to
          be exchanged meaningfully despite their syntax."
"Even if syntax interoperability is not achieved in a pan-European framework, it has to be possible to
          transform from a syntax vocabulary to another one without loosing."
"It is
          required to work on the semantic interoperability for electronic attestations and certificates that
          requires not only semantic alignment but legal alignment in Europe.”(Bausa O. and Boujraf A."
"2009)
          Requirement
          Evidential documents exchanged between parties MUST be semantically harmonized in order
          to be processed electronically."
"Description
          National criteria for qualitative selection and exclusion should be formulated in a way that they can be
          mapped to European criteria for qualitative selection and exclusion mentioned by the Articles 45-50."
"Requirement
          National criteria for qualitative selection and exclusion MUST correspond to European criteria which
          are derived from Article 45-50 and which are partially described in the Eligibility of Tenders."
"Description
          Any instance of a VCD requires to be defined for a particular economic operator."
"Next to this it is the
          aim of the work package to make each VCD specific to a particular Call for Tender."
"The pre-VCD
          mapping tool therefore will provide sufficient support and has to be integrated into a VCD system."
A unique VCD identifier needs to be established.
"Description
          A VCD package will show its full potential only when all requested evidences (all that are necessary to
          prove all the requested criteria) are contained within it."
"From a very pragmatic point
          of view it seems reasonable to focus on a subset of attestations in a first step and to complete the
          VCD Package later on."
"It is also reasonably to define, where and when permitted, a default packaging
          list of tender independent criteria to be served without the burden of reading or interpreting the “Call
          for Tender”."
"Requirement
          When implementing any tool, system or service WP2 MUST focus on mandatory requirements and
          evidences mentioned in Articles 45 and 46 first since theses Articles are not tender-specific and
          therewith relevant for nearly all tenders."
"Measurement
          Any definition, specification, modelling or implementation will first focus on Article 45 to 46
          Requirement
          The mapping between evidences via requirements MUST have set a primary focus on the mandatory
          requirements and evidences of a VCD."
"Measurement
          The definition, specification, modelling or implementation of the pre-VCD mapping tool will focus on
          Articles 45 to 46
          Requirement
          Articles 47 to 50 open a wide range of different criteria which are tender- and country-specific thus
          they MUST be added stepwise to the pre-VCD mapping tool (which may require a higher-level
          mapping)."
"Requirement
          Any VCD system SHOULD provide the opportunity to the economic operator to produce a complete
          VCD even if there are several issuing services that are not under control of a national service provider,
          do not have specific mapping to other documents defined in the pre-VCD mapping tool and have to be
          provided by the economic operator manually."
"Description
          Since the completeness of a VCD package should be ensured but a complete mapping of evidence
          may not be provided as especially the criteria of Articles 49 to 50 of the directive are unstructured and
          much dependent on tender-specific requirements it has to be possible to define placeholders where a
          contracting authority may complete the mapping on individual basis through uploading evidence to
          these placeholders."
"Description
          The VCD system should provide a functionality that allows issuing bodies to submit evidence to it."
Therefore interfaces to submit evidence to the VCD system have to be defined.
"Thereby manual, semiautomated
          and automated interfaces have to be separated
          Requirement
          Interfaces to submit evidence to the VCD system have to be defined along with common semantics in
          order to allow issuing bodies to further specify evidence with regard to structural data, context specific
          data and validation values."
"Measurement
          Interface to upload evidence or to retrieve evidence contains possibility to specify structural data
          manually or automatically"
"Description
          Any VCD package that is created by a VCD system should be an artefact that can be interpreted
          without using specific technology."
"Requirement
          Develop a format that allows the presentation and displaying of the contents of a VCD package."
"Description
          The implementation of different stages of maturity requires a general approach that defines which
          parts are mandatory and ensure semantic interoperability of VCD packages."
"The below mentioned
          requirements provide guidance for and further explain where mandatory and optional requirements
          can be found."
"Requirement
          The pre-VCD mapping tool (Stage 1) MUST be filled with instances (defined) by every Member State
          since Stage 1 is a precondition for any other stage."
"Measurement
          Pre-VCD mapping tool filled with national instances
          Requirement
          The VCD simple package (Stage 2) lays the basic ground for the creation of VCDs and the
          implementation of other services mentioned in stages 3 and 4 so the key concepts of Stage 2 MUST
          be implemented in each Member States."
"Measurement
          Key concepts such as structural data of evidence applied to VCD package
          Requirement
          Stage 3 (VCD advanced package) and stage 4 (VCD networked package) introduce a set of optional
          functions that SHOULD be considered by each Member State when implementing a VCD."
"Requirement
          The stages are logically built upon each other but it MUST be possible to implement certain features of
          stage 4 if the necessary requirements for this are fulfilled in the lower stages even if maybe not all
          requirements are fulfilled in stage 3."
"certified “Yes/No” statements) should only be applied to networks where
          sufficient context specific data is available in order to approve this value."
"The validation value should
          be able to prove conformance to criteria of qualitative exclusion and selection unambiguously."
"This
          principle should be applied wherever possible for example:
          • The economic operator has to prove that he paid fiscal taxes according to national regulations – in
          this case a “Yes/No statement” will be sufficient."
"• The economic operator has to provide balance sheet or extracts from it in order to proof its
          economic or financial standing – in this case the whole attestation (balance sheet or extracts of it)
          has to be delivered."
"- If sufficient context specific data format for representing those information unambiguously is
          available it may be applied for stage 4."
this has a high priority to be included into stage 3 and stage 4.
"Requirement
          If attestations are described sufficiently in multiple lingual versions they SHOULD be included first to
          stages 3 and 4."
"Requirement
          If the prove concentrates on qualitative aspects (e.g."
"provide balance sheet or extracts from it in order
          to proof its economic or financial standing) then the validation value cannot be applied."
"Instead such
          an attestation can be included into VCD stages 3 and 4 if it is sufficiently described through context
          specific data in multilingual versions (e.g."
"Description
          “A classification scheme is the descriptive information for an arrangement or division of objects into
          groups based on characteristics that the objects have in common”20."
"“Classification schemes and code lists conveys semantics to the objects so they are a key factor to
          achieve semantic interoperability."
"As it is quite
          complex to establish a common and unique classification scheme cross-border and cross-sector,
          business document instances should be carry metadata about classification schemes they use.”
          (Bausa O. and Boujraf A."
"Supporting pan-European procurement and implementing services to enable pan-European
        deployment of evidences is the major goal of PEPPOL WP2."
"Any WP2 solution therefore needs to
        comply with the legal requirements concerning selection and exclusion criteria in public procurement
        defined by the European procurement directives and in national implementing legislation."
"Compliance with these regulations will ensure acceptance of a solution and will ensure and help to
        establish a ""level of trust"" between the parties involved."
"Therefore a comprehensive analysis of the
        relevant legal regulation has to take place."
"To get an overview on the legal requirements and
        regulations on different levels the following sources have to be analysed:"
"The requirements have to be fulfilled or further
        analysed and specified in order to further draft the legal framework for a VCD to a greater extent."
"Description
          The principle of equal treatment is often mentioned by the directive 2004/18/EC for example in
          connection with contracts that should be awarded on the basis of objective criteria which ensure
          compliance with the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and equal treatment and which
          guarantee that tenders are assessed in conditions of effective competition."
"Therefore Article 52(5) states that “economic operators from other Member
          States may not be obliged to undergo such registration or certification in order to participate in a public
          contract."
"Requirement
          The VCD SHOULD support that economic operators from foreign member states may not be treated
          harder than own member state’s economic operators."
"It has to be defined whether a VCD
          package can have its own validity or if its validity is only based on the contained information."
"Requirement
          The possibility of a definition of a minimum validity of a VCD package has to be defined
          Measurement
          Data type in Structural VCD package data which specifies validity for the whole package
          3.3.2.3 Equivalence between automated transformation and official translation of attestations"
"Description
          The use of context-specific formats that include multi-lingual versions of attestations should ensure
          that an automated transformation from one language version into another language version delivers
          results that have from the viewpoint of official translations, a similar legal status."
"Requirement
          The provision of attestations that are available in context-specific formats including multi-lingual
          versions and their transformation into any target language has to guarantee similar legal status and
          effect is reached compared to official translation."
"Description
          A contracting authority sends a contract notice to a Publication body that publishes the call."
"The Call
          for Tender should contain the definition of specific criteria on qualitative selection and exclusion that
          are relevant to this particular procurement."
"If an economic operator decides to participate in a particular procurement procedure he can directly
          retrieve the relevant criteria by using the information published in the contract notice."
"The economic operator will be enabled to get a mapping to the relevant national
          attestations via the pre-VCD mapping tool."
"subsection 3.1.2.8: “Specification of criteria subset by
          the Procurer”; and subsection 3.1.2.9: “Provision of criteria subset by the Economic Operator”
          Requirement
          The contracting authority SHOULD specify a subset of evidences from the superset evidences that are
          relevant to a specific Call for Tender."
"Description
          Description
          Article 52(5) states “that contracting authorities shall recognise equivalent certificates from bodies
          established in other Member States."
Which role trusted third parties (TTP) must take in this respect (e.g.
"Does mutual recognition provide support to
              submit scanned copies to other Member States which require official scans that are produces by
              dedicated public authority?"
"Description
            Which roles do candidate statements take in general and specifically as replacement for attestations
            that cannot be provided?"
"Which roles take candidate statements with regard to mutual recognition and
            which conditions have to be fulfilled to provide candidate statements instead of attestations within
            public procurement procedures?"
"Is mutual recognition and the use of candidate statements bound to
            those cases where equivalent documents are missing or can mutual recognition of candidate
            statements cover other conditions or conventions as well (e.g."
"Requirement
            The scope of mutual recognition needs to be further clarified with regard to the role of candidate
            statements."
"Description
            Not every Member State provides all attestations that are necessary for an economic operator to prove
            conformance with given criteria specified by another Member State."
"Thus only the economic operators
            from Member States where such attestations are available can provide these attestations."
"Other
            economic operators have to provide similar evidence instead (e.g."
"The
            working group has to provide a concept of how each possible attestation has to be fulfilled (mapping of
            evidences defined in the directive with national implementation)."
"Thereby the evidences provided by
            economic operator should be considered of equal value as evidences provided by a traditional issuing
            body if equivalence is missing
            Requirement
            It has to be defined which method and concept should be applied if there are missing attestations."
"In order to achieve good mapping results it has to be
          checked whether these articles are sufficiently implemented into national procurement law."
"ANNEX III: Questionnaire concerning the legal analysis)
          Requirement
          It has to be guaranteed whether the directive is correctly implemented in national procurement law
          with regard to VCD relevant articles 45-52."
"Description
          In case a MS decides to exchange validation values (e.g."
"certified “Yes/No” statements) instead of
          delivering an attestation physically (stage 4 specific) it MUST ensure that this provision is legally
          allowed."
"The requirement is strongly related to the organisational
          requirement: “Scope with regard to Article 52”."
"This section contains requirements concerning a European Service Provider who may host services
            necessary to ensure sustainable interoperability between VCD solutions in long terms."
"In particular a
            European Service Provider refers to the pre-VCD mapping tool which will provide a basis for all other
            VCD application in the subsequent stages."
"Several formal legal
            requirements have to be answered previously in order to define the scope of such European Service

"Description
            This section contains requirements concerning a National Service Provider who may host services
            necessary to ensure sustainable interoperability of a national VCD solution in long term."
"In particular a
            National Service Provider refers to any VCD system and VCD package that is developed within a
            Member State."
"Several formal legal requirements
            have to be answered previously in order to define the scope of such a National Service Provider

            (e.g."
"Measurement
            Necessity for amendments of existing regulations has to be proofed."
"Description
          In many countries there are certain regulations with regard to evidences that have to be considered."
"For example in some countries it is not allowed to directly issue an extract from the register of
          conviction to the economic operator but to directly deliver these evidence to the requesting authority."
"Data
          protection is the main piece of legislation that governs the protection of personal or entity related data
          in a way in which individuals or entities can enforce the control of information about themselves."
"Although data protection does not directly refer to principles like data privacy, data confidentiality, data
          availability, non-repudiation of data, data integrity and data security these principles are strongly
          connected to data protection."
"Therefore the rules and regulations in each Member State have to be analysed with regard
          to the prospects of separating these two parts from each other."
"This may also include for example to
          submit a VCD package via the PEPPOL infrastructure while submitting other parts or the bid itself via
          secondary channels or whether tendering platforms enable such separation."
"Requirement
          It MUST be clarified which prospects and limitations exists within a Member State to separate a VCD
          package from the tender itself."
"Description
          There are several actors that are involved in the processes related to WP2 and these processes have
          to be defined with regard to trust between the entities involved (e.g."
"Trust models have to be defined for each process in order to clarify roles and responsibilities during
          transactions."
"On the
          European level it may include the “scope of mutual recognition” for example the trust between the
          national service provider who provides a VCD simple package and the European service provider who
          provides a particular mapping facility."
"Requirement
          A trust model and trust system MUST be defined from a legal point of view for every process which
          includes the roles and responsibilities of the entities involved."
"Description
          “Some documents exchanged during the electronic procurement process have to be legally valid
          following EU Directives."
"Directive 2004/18 states that the public procurement procedures and the rules applicable to service
          contests require a level of security and confidentiality higher than that required by Directives."
"Accordingly, the devices for the electronic receipt of offers, requests to participate and plans and
          projects should comply with specific additional requirements."
"Moreover, the
          existence of voluntary accreditation schemes could constitute a favourable framework for enhancing
          the level of certification service provision for these devices.” (Bausa O. and Boujraf A."
"This chapter shall include technical requirements that are essential for submitting a VCD via the
        PEPPOL infrastructures."
"Thereby it connects
        to existing e-business frameworks and value added networks and is being built on existing
        technologies and standards that have been tested and which have proven to be reliable and secure
        for enterprise use."
"WP2 takes a specific role within the project by concentrating on pre-awarding
        issues where requirements and procedures are often stricter due to principle like equal treatment, nondiscrimination,
        transparency, competition etc."
"Although a VCD does not include the offer itself it
        provides several documents that are of great importance for the award of contracts and therewith
        critical for the success of an economic operator for example in cases of disqualification because of late
        delivery of a VCD."
"An overall pre-condition for using the infrastructure and WP2 solutions in long term is that they are
        governed even after the project lifetime by maintaining and sustaining its functions."
"Authentication is an essential feature of WP2 as a Virtual Company Dossier contains several
        documents that contain sensitive data about an economic operator."
"Hence, it has to be ensured that
        only those persons that have sufficient rights are able to access and retrieve these data."
"Authentication of origin is also an important feature with regard to non-repudiation, for example when
        submitting a VCD to a contracting authority."
"Authentication is a verification of evidence of identity; for individuals and companies identifiers are
        used to process authentication."
PEPPOL will need to design an authentication system that serves its purposes.
"Time-stamping shall ensure that the submission of a VCD is adequately documented for example to
        verify that it has been sent or received previously to the closure of a call for tender."
"Moreover there are several actors involved in the WP2 scenarios which need to be connected to the
        PEPPOL infrastructure thus a sufficient allocation of identifiers, in connection with the identity an actor
        claims to have, has to be ensured."
"This shall ensure that unauthorized usage of an individuals’ identity
        is avoided."
"Overall we see a need for commonly monitored identity and access management in
        particular for all national VCD solutions and for the PEPPOL infrastructure thus both approaches
        should be aligned and should make use of the same mechanisms through for example single-sign-on
        functionality."
"Apart from functionalities like addressability and discovery, the infrastructure should provide access
        points to support the actors or services to connect to the infrastructure."
"The PEPPOL infrastructure will
        make it possible to exchange electronic business documents in a secure and reliable manner."
"Thus
        also the VCD should be able to be submitted through the PEPPOL infrastructure."
"We also assume
        that a VCD in stages 2 and 3 can be potentially submitted through other means but this is up to the
        choice of an economic operator and should not be promoted because bypassing the infrastructure is
        critical from the viewpoint of using validation services to ensure confidentiality of a VCD and its
        contained documents (WP1) and secure and reliable transport ensured through the PEPPOL
        infrastructure (WP8)."
"During transportation the integrity of a VCD has to be ensured when for example
        validating it."
"national
        service providers, contracting authorities) will be implemented but also direct access points that
        support SMEs in connecting to it."
"We also see a potential need to access web services via the
        infrastructure that enable client-side code generation in SOAP frameworks for example for the retrieval
        of attestations on demand, connecting to tendering platforms or viewing the VCD on some platform at
        the national service provider."
"The requirements have to be fulfilled or further analysed and
        specified with in conjunction with WP1 and WP8 in order to further draft the technical framework with
        regard to the VCD."
"A governing model has to be defined in order to deploy the WP2 systems and tools and to maintain
          their states and sustainability over time."
"In this respect the composition, structure and scope of the
          governing model has to be formally defined to ensure fulfilment of functions like liability, sustainability
          and maintainability (e.g."
"especially to maintain and sustain a pre-VCD mapping tool in long term and
          therewith to ensure (re-)liable functions) The dedicated governing model should have the necessary
          status and power to govern its assigned functions."
"Requirement
          It MUST be clarified how the governance model of WP2 fits into the overall governance model of WP8."
Economic operators have to apply for a VCD account in order to become authenticated.
"An officer has
          to verify whether the data that is necessary to apply for an account belongs to the economic operator
          and has to assure its correctness."
"An economic operator can authenticate to the VCD system only
          when the economic operator has sufficient user rights provided by identity and access management."
"Thereby WP2 has to take into account which natural person has the power to act as authorized
          representative of the economic operator."
"Description
          Work package 2 will use the PEPPOL infrastructure for discovering addressing information which is
          typically stored in a registry."
"Therefore we need to find a method how addresses can be allocated and
          being provided to the WP 2 stakeholders so that they can use the PEPPOL infrastructure for
          exchanging VCDs and access related services."
"Requirement
          A method MUST be found how to allocate identifiers to the participants that use the infrastructure for
          transportation of VCDs and related services."
"Measurement
          Joined strategy and method with WP8 how to allocate identifiers among stakeholders and WP2 related
          services."
"Those national based systems are evolving without
          taking into account the requirement for interoperability that is needed in a cross-border scenario,
          resulting in a fragmented service that prevents the deployment of pan-European electronic services."
"In the public procurement business process, as in other electronic business processes, electronic
          identity is a key element for two main purposes:
          Avoiding unauthorized use of individuals identity
          Assuring to administrations that individuals are the persons they claim to be and have the mandate
          they claim to have” (Bausa O. and Boujraf A."
"2009)
          Requirement
          Every party participating MUST be uniquely identifiable"
"However, using websites is not a good
          approach when dealing with services that affect business processes in both ends of a collaboration."
"Those business processes, such as the public procurement processes, can be run between
          applications, so no human intervention should be enforced to those organizations with automated
          procurement systems."
"In such cases, every partner in the collaboration needs to be addressable so electronic documents
          can be exchanged from end to end through the underlying transport infrastructure.” (Bausa O. and
          Boujraf A."

"Description
        “To exchange electronic documents between parties in a cross-border environment, a major challenge
        is to find out the other party’s address and to understand what are his systems’ capabilities and
        requirements."
"Different levels of maturity and implementation of electronic business interfaces on public
        administrations and economic operators across Europe obliges to create mechanisms for discovering
        the supported standards, documents and endpoints for trader partners.” (Bausa O. and Boujraf A."
"2009)
        Requirement
        In stage 4 it MUST be possible to discover the verified electronic address for an identified party."
"The PEPPOL infrastructure will make it possible to exchange electronic business documents in a
          secure and reliable manner."
"It connects existing frameworks and networks, but also allows small
          businesses to participate in the electronic business processes if they have Internet access and can be
          securely identified."
"The PEPPOL infrastructure is being built on existing technologies and standards
          that have been tested and which have proven to be reliable and secure to use."
"For WP2 it will
          important to access the infrastructure from different perspectives."
"An economic operator for example
          has to submit a VCD via the PEPPOL infrastructure."
"A contracting authority may require access to a
          database hosted by a national service provider to receive an attestation by using a direct reference to
          it."
"Some web services may be connected to the infrastructure to add additional functionalities to a VCD
          or for example to receive mapping information from the pre-VCD mapping tool."
"Description
          The VCD is just one part of bid that an economic operator may submit to a contracting authority."
"Therefore the systems in each Member State have to be analysed with regard to the prospects of
          separating both parts from each other."
"This may include for example to submit a VCD via the PEPPOL
          infrastructure while submitting other parts or the bid itself via secondary channels or whether tendering
          platforms enable such separation."
"Requirement
          It MUST be clarified whether tendering platforms enable a separated submission of a VCD and the bid
          itself."

          WP1 assumes that all actors can sign inside their corporate infrastructure."
"The e-tendering platform
          must offer download functionality for forms and other material to be filled in, signed, and returned by
          an economic operator."
"A validation service may be a technical service or a Validation Authority (VA)
          that takes on liability and acts as a trust anchor of its own."
"Validation services may be chained in
          order to serve requests that cannot be handled by the “local” validation service."
"Requirement
          It MUST be possible to apply the validation service provided by WP1 to a VCD in order to enable
          economic operators to guarantee data integrity and confidentiality of a VCD."
"Requirement
          It MUST be clarified whether the VCD can use the validation service of WP1 if the transportation
          infrastructure is not used by an economic operator."
"Description
          “The purpose of an e-business transport infrastructure is to transport business documents between

          “In electronic procurement it is fundamental to create a trust “environment” for the economic operator."
It could be also a good deterrent against insider.” (Bausa O. and Boujraf A.

"The report
        documents various attestations of the Member States which are arranged according to the Articles 45
        to 50 of Directive 2004/18/EC (Siemens_and_Time.lex 2007):"
"The questionnaire
        contains a set of European criteria and requirements derived from directive 2004/18/EC and
        connected to specific evidences in order to make them comparable among Member States."
"Besides
        that, results from the ”Study on the proposal for a tool for a mutual information mechanism on the
        electronic provision of certificates and attestations usually required in public procurement procedures”
        and the country profile templates developed by Siemens Time.lex commissioned by DG MARKT have
        been Stage 1, the pre-VCD mapping tool, will be built upon this information by providing automated
        mappings and comparisons between the defined documents via the mentioned exclusion criteria (cf."
"Combining structural information about evidence and the criteria mentioned in the “Eligibility of
        Tenderes” they are referring to, it will be firstly possible to set up a database with common definitions
        that referring to evidences and secondly to define precise mapping between those evidences via the
        templates."
"This will also enable VCDs of the
        piloting country to work on a wider scope."
"Even if a country hasn’t defined a pilot implementation for a
        VCD it can receive and interpret a VCD according to the information provided by the pre-VCD
        mapping tool."
"The next section provides an overview of relevant technologies that may enable such a mapping of
        evidence."
"This section provides an overview about relevant technologies that can be applied for a pre-VCD
          mapping tool."
"The pre-VCD mapping tool is depending upon formal semantics that describe how
          evidences related to each other."
"Therefore WP 2 proposes to derive criteria from the European
          directive 2004/18/EC as shown for instance within the “Eligibility of Tenderers”."
"Using formal
          semantics with the proposed technologies as presented in section 4.1.3 below enables several
          advantages (Fensel, Lausen et al."
Enable mapping: This involves the creation of certain rules and axioms that define how terms or evidences within one Member State map to terms and evidences within another Member State
Enable alignment: Refers to the commitment that has to be made in order to determine correspondences between concepts.
"Alignment is used to find classes of data that are semantically equivalent, but indeed not necessarily logically identical (e.g."
Enable translation: Refers to syntactic rewriting and semantic rewriting to support the translation between two different representations of data.
Enable merging: Describes the creations of a common model that is used instead of the national models.
Merging different national models into a unified one is an approach for semantic integration which is particularly used when national models overlap significantly over a common domain.
"For enabling machines to process data directly, database objects have to be mapped into a system of URIs."
URIs using a global naming convention to identify resources thus they are central for semantic interoperability.
Resources are associated with a URI so that anyone can link / refer to it and may access an appropriate representation of it.
RDF provides a standard form for representing semantics of data which can be processed by machines.
The RDF metadata model allows to define statements about resources by using so called triple stores (subject-predicate-object expressions).
Resources in RDF are connected to specific URIs that allow to derive information about the resource and its meaning.
OWL is designed to enable applications to process the content of information instead of just presenting information to humans.
The main idea of OWL is to support an efficient representation of ontologies as well as the support of decision procedures.
OWL allows to refer to terms in other ontologies and it uses the linking provided by RDF to enable the distribution of ontologies among different systems
Logical reasoning is needed to ensure the consistency and correctness of data sets.
It is used to infer conclusions that are not explicitly stated but are consistent with and required by a known set of data.

"on the other hand, the VCD Service Provider in a respective country, who communicates with the European Service Provider for the mapping, and who implements the compilation of a VCD for the economic operator in his/her country (supporting stages 2 – 4 of the VCD concept introduced)."
France and Norway intend to implement stage 4;
"Belgium, Czech Republic and Greece aim to implement VCD packages of stages 2-3;"
Sweden intends to implement stage 1.
"The intention is to create a system, which can handle all functions of a stage 3 VCD advanced
        package solution, and thereby achieve:"
"requester of the VCD package) and copes with the necessary pan-European requirements regarding criterion selection, evidence selection and issuing service approval (including the interaction with the European VCD service provider regarding the pre-VCD mapping)."
"osSso Machine This component interprets the international rule set (ontology), generates a list of service to be called in order to furnish the required evidences for the given criteria and passes the resulting service chain to the SOA engine."
"SOA Engine This component is in charge of calling the issuing service following the service chain, which has been constructed by the osSso machine."
"Part of the implementation will be the creation of issuing service profiles, which enable the integration of manual, semi-automated and automated Austrian issuing services."
VCD packager This component constructs the physical VCD package following the internationally agreed upon VCD advanced package design.
"The piloting phase of the Austrian VCD implementation will include several selected stakeholders,
        which take up key positions in the Austrian procurement landscape."
"Italy plans to adapt its current company’s dossier builder to the design and implementation principles
        set by PEPPOL WP2."
"The interoperability dimension represents the challenge
        at the moment as very few transactions take place across borders and when they are performed they
        represent a heavy burden for those attending their execution."
"Italy is pressing on this by adopting different measures, i.e., by improving the organizational
        infrastructure, by offering better visibility of the involved organizations, by designing and developing
        policies that increase the trust among national and European organizations, by improving the
        information processing environment in order to reach the requirements set by the PEPPOL
        community."
"The conformance to PEPPOL’s WP2 interoperability standards will be approached by following the
        project agreed roadmap that includes the design and management of a dynamic knowledge base,
        known as the pre-VCD mapping tool and by implementing VCD services that conform to a multi-stage
        approach."
"For PEPPOL’s project runtime, Italy is planning to reach Stage 2 as ultimate stage in its
        system and services evolution along with solid contributions for the analysis and design of the upper
        level stages."
"The Italian implementation approach includes a long preparation activity that focuses more on legal
        investigation rather than technical engineering."
"Effort will be spent on refining and consolidating the document’s acquisition infrastructure that
        represents a multi-site networking system to reach the different certification authorities that are the
        authoritative suppliers of documents essential to the VCD package construction."
"The piloting phase of the Italian VCD service will include the technical actions identified by the
        implementation plan and some interfacing events to reach selected stakeholders and define through
        their input the driving conditions for the VCD setup."
"The requirements and contents contained in chapters 2, 3 and 4 can be aggregated according to the
    following aspects:
    Level of support: The different levels of support address the maturity of the service and the maturity
    of the VCD package, where the former correspond to the functionalities (e.g."
"Level of completeness: A VCD Package will show its full potential when all the requested
    attestations (all that are necessary to prove all requested criteria) are contained in it."
"The VCD
    promotes a step wise approach in order to reach a sufficient level of completeness by concentrating
    first on evidences with regard to Articles 45 – 46 and afterwards on evidences with regard to Articles
    47 – 50."
"Criteria for qualification and selection and non-exclusion: The criteria for qualitative selection and
    non-exclusion as defined in Article 45 to 50 of Directive 2004/18/EC are the common ground for
    building a cross border VCD service."
"Pre-VCD mapping tool: Provides a widely available tool which contains the up-to-date mappings of
    European criteria and evidences."
"Tender specific requirements then have to be stated by
    contracting authorities according to the European criteria during notification phase in order to derive
    tender specific mapping results on evidences required to submit at tendering (Subset)."
"VCD simple package: Establishment of a VCD system which consist of VCD services, hosted by a
    VCD service provider."
"VCD services are capable to collect evidences from different sources and
    compiling VCD packages from it."
Types of data contained in a VCD: Provide the basis for a common structure of a VCD.
"tender specific data that refer to a particular Call for Tender, the evidences itself as electronic file or
    scanned copy and structural data of evidence that describe the evidences according to generic
    aspects)."
"VCD advanced package: Introduces several additional VCD services that increase the level of
    support for the entities involved."
"Economic operators are for example enabled to maintain their data
    through re-compilation of a VCD or to merge their VCD with VCDs’ from other economic operators in
    order to create groups of economic operators for bidding consortia."
"VCD advanced package also
    introduces context specific data as additional type of data that describe the content of an attestation in
    a machine interpretable format."
"VCD networked package: Introduces “on-demand” retrieval of attestations that are sufficiently
    described through context specific data."
"The VCD networked package offers a good opportunity for a
    national service provider to establish official list of approved economic operators as foreseen in Article
    52 (1) of Directive 2004/18/EC."
"Therefore national service providers have to store attestations and
    referencing to it within the VCD."
"Contracting authorities are mandated to request attestations in
    individual cases (“on demand”) if they do not trust on the list of approved economic operators."
"They are independent of a particular implementation or stage thus they are
    called organisational requirements for a VCD."
"They are
    independent of a particular VCD implementation or stage thus they are called legal requirements for a
    VCD."
"Semantic Framework: Lists the requirements which form the semantic basis for any of the VCD
    stages."
"They are independent of a particular implementation or stage thus they are called semantic
    requirements for a VCD."
"The technical framework lists several
    requirements that are essential to specify the technical (transportation and validation) basis in order to
    submit any WP2 solution across borders."
"They are independent of a particular implementation or
    stage thus they are called technical requirements for a VCD."
"SWOT Analysis is a strategic planning method used to evaluate the Strengths, Weaknesses,
      Opportunities, and Threats of a project or intention."
"A SWOT analysis usually starts by defining an end
      state or objective which has been done for WP2 in chapter 2 and subsequent chapters."
"The aim of
      any SWOT analysis is to identify the key internal and external factors that influence the achievements
      of this objective."
"The major objective of this deliverable is to develop a concept for a VCD and to define major
        requirements that shape this VCD concept."
"Therefore we have defined different scenarios and a vision
        that contains several different levels of maturity."
"With the staged maturity model we intend to reach a
        wide flexibility and openness of such a solution encompassing all Member States to implement their
        individual preferences."
"Nevertheless the concept provides common grounds such as the pre-VCD
        mapping and structural data of evidences which ensures interoperability of evidences and their
        perception across borders."
"Beside we defined a set of requirements on organisational, semantic,
        technical and legal level that clarify general aspect of VCD development and deployment."
"To support the mutual recognition of evidences across border the VCD requires an underlying
        semantic model that enables a standardized classification and mapping between them (pre-VCD
        mapping tool)."
"If the contracting authority specifies the relevant evidences which are related to criteria,
        the data can be processed automatically in order to look-up the evidences required within another
        Member State."
"The aim is to support basic interoperability and exchange of documents on the
        lower maturity levels and leading towards direct electronic exchange of evidence in the higher maturity
        levels."
"The VCD shall ensure that a significant part of the public procurement processes can be made
        through electronic cross-border transactions."
"Therefore the national focus of a VCD needs to be
        enhanced through a cross border perspective."
"A VCD provides a single point of contact for an economic operator that enables him to invoke and
        manage different services to create a VCD."
"The VCD services merge data from
        several sources into a single container and make this data available and understandable to the actors
        involved."
"Economic operators will be enabled to perform checks with regard to the existence and
        validity of the requested evidences in the VCD package."
"Structural data of evidence will provide
        guidance for foreign contracting authorities to understand the evidences contained within a VCD and
        they can trust that general information since it is provided by national VCD service providers that take
        the role of trusted parties."
"Context specific data will be provided on the higher levels to increase
        decision support."
There are also some weaknesses that can be identified for the overall concept.
"The development of standards and context
        specific vocabularies is time consuming and requires long term involvement of user groups that will
        make use of these standards."
"The VCD contains several different kinds of evidences and to develop
        common standards for each one cannot be a major task and focus of this work package and should be
        done by initiative such as CEN BII, BRITE, XBRL or ECRIS."
"Since CEN BII workshop is close to an
        end it will probably not work out to do this development within its scope."
"Nevertheless we will start to
        develop comm of contents and marginal variances in their contents."
"Furthermore we rely on structural
        data of evidences that describe and characterize evidence from a more generic point of view."
"The “selective translation” could be
        arranged in multiple languages in particular when context specific data belongs to a common agreed
        dictionary of expressions."
"Thus the resolution of language
        barriers and linguistic issues cannot be completely managed by a VCD in short term and may require
        adding official translations beside selective translations."
"This direct information exchange would provide many
        opportunities with regard to increase the actuality of evidence, to lower the transaction costs of the
        parties involved and to reduce the time to create a VCD."
"Nevertheless such direct exchange is very
        difficult to establish because a lot of entities and attestation services have to be federated, access
        policies have to be developed, legal uncertainties have to be resolved and political guidelines have to
        be considered."
"To circumvent these problems the VCD provides in particular in stage 4 a guideline on
        how to move forward in order to reach this ambitious aim but it will not be a major focus of a VCD as
        such."
The VCD will be dependent on a number of services that rely on manual and semi-automated input.
"Thus the VCD system will be primary a tool for the economic operator to arrange a VCD package
        instance which is conform according to the requirements stated in particular call for tender which he
        can fill through additional inputs."
"A direct access to attestation via the national VCD service provider
        can only be provided for those public attestations that are already available in electronic format."
"The
        VCD will not enforce any development of electronic attestation on a national level as this is a clear
        national duty and is depended upon the development of context specific data."
"Nevertheless existing
        attestations may be extended through additional annotations that describe these documents
        generically (structural data of evidences)."
Unclear yet is the role of Member States that have already implemented Article 5224.
"The scope of
        mutual recognition needs to be further clarified with regard to acceptance of these procedures across
        borders and the liability of those trusted third parties across borders."
"It needs to be further defined how
        a VCD can support countries that have implemented Article 52 but since there are currently no pilots in
        our work package that have such procedures already implemented we have left this out of scope."
"Neverton representations (context specific data) for evidences that have an, easy structure,
        low quantityheless we see a great opportunity to combine both ideas as shown in stage 4."
"In the long-run the VCD should be able to adequately fulfil the
        contracting authorities’ need to proof conformance to certain criteria for qualitative selection and
        exclusion while reducing the burden of proof for the Economic Operator."
"The same burden lays on contracting authorities who
        have to check for each evidence whether the issuer has appropriate rights within that country to
        provide evidence."
"Furthermore the possibility to re-use evidences that are still valid (time) and the
        maintenance of a VCD will again provide possibilities for cost reductions at the side of the economic
        operator."
"A paradigm shift towards electronic exchange of evidence and a next generation of attestations and
        certificates that are currently barely available in electronic form may be promoted by a VCD."
"At least
        the structural representation of attestation will provide benefit for the entities involved by providing
        transparency about the tendering requirements and the evidences that have to be submitted in cross
        border procedures."
"In contrast a VCD package contains the data necessary to prove the suitability of an economic
        operator according to these requirements."
"Challenges to be dissolved when facing in particular the European perspectives of a VCD are
        mentioned by (Siemens_and_Time.lex 2008):"
"The
      report lists requirements that scope a potential solution according to the different levels of maturity and
      generic requirements."
"These requirements now have to be taken further into account in order to
      specify the VCD and implement the various stages."
"To facilitate management of the requirements,
      they will be transformed into a spreadsheet with information as shown in Table 11."
"A distinction will be
      made among functional requirements, non-functional requirements and requirements that specifically
      refer to the development process."
"Maintaining them over the project lifetime
      will ensure that the requirements are complete, explicitly defined, clearly described, numbered and
      referenced."
"Further characteristics to evaluate the quality of requirements will be considered such as
      their determinability (atomic character), verifiability (well defined measurement towards the fulfilment of
      a requirement), traceability (tracking of complete fulfilment as well as of where a requirement emerged
      from) and consistency (conflicts between requirements such as contrary features or quality aspects)."
"Taking the PEPPOL development infrastructure guidelines, SCRUM25 or the
      waterfall model (McDermind_and_Rook, 1991) as reference models, the next phase focuses now on
      the detailed design of the VCD concept as presented above."
"This phase will further detail the
      requirements through explicit models and artefacts that describe relevant process flows, data
      characteristics and software."
Drafting agreed models requires interdisciplinary work between participants with different skills.
"Software engineers thereby may design a software model for the mapping of evidences together with
      legal experts that ensure the legitimacy of such a model."
"Furthermore we intend to work closely
      together CEN BII workshop and DG Markt (including Siemens and Time.lex) when drafting these models
      in order to ensure long term sustainability of the solution envisaged."
"Departing from a description of the current procedure when economic operators
    collect the necessary evidences as proofs of selection and exclusion criteria in public tenders, the
    team of work package 2 has elaborated a four-stage vision for the VCD."
"With the implementation of stage 1, the pre-VCD mapping, a first level of
    interoperability and facilitation to collect the necessary evidences for a public tender in another
    Member State is supported."
"Throughout the analysis, elaboration and definition of the VCD concept plus the necessary research
    affiliated with this activity, fruitful insights could be collected about dependencies and
    interrelationships, which make this domain rather complex."
"The project team is aware of the fact that the VCD concept conceptualised in this report is rather
    generous – especially if we attempt to implement stage 4 of the VCD vision."
"A big step towards
    interoperability and cross-border facilitation in the collection of company information of economic
    operators can already be made when implementing the pre-VCD mapping tool."
"Consequently, a recommendation is given to focus implementation on the pre-VCD mapping tool for
    widespread application of a VCD at first hand."
"They form the test cases for a wider
    rollout of the VCD concept as developed throughout phase 1 of work package 2 within PEPPOL."

"The
software will be used to search multiple web sites for streaming videos and torrents
and return these results to the user."
"This document will cover the features of the software and include specifics on what
the system will do and any constraints and external factors that might affect the
system."
"It will also be used by the potential users of the
product to get their opinions on the software, this will help to revise and improve the
product."
"Also mentioned are the constraints that will affect the system and the
interface."
"The third section, the System Features, gives a full description of the actions
preformed by the system and gives details on the functions that are executed."
"All
the major services that will be provided by the product are documented here."
"This
section will give a description on hardware and software interfaces that the Video
Searching software requires to perform an action."
"This will give the requirements for the software when
dealing with external entities and restrictions."
"This Video Searching software will be a system that uses an active internet
connection to search multiple websites for streaming videos or torrents."
"The system
will be used to aid the user when trying to locate a specific video or genre of video."
"It will help them reduce searching time through various different websites by
searching all these websites with just one query."
"It provides tools to help when
navigating through search results which will save time and effort."
"The software aims to help the user by providing a simple interface and a more
efficient way of finding the video they require."
"It will also provide the user with various options and tools to help make their search more relevant to the content
that they need."
"The system will contain databases of the different websites that will
be used within the search."
"These databases can be easily updated to provide a
wider searching range."
"From these
studies we saw that the main activity people used video for was the watch content
found online."
"These people would regularly spend periods of time searching
websites to try and find the videos they wanted to watch, either somewhere to
stream the video from or the files to download the video."
"Our system will aim
to speed up this process."
"The user can specify which
of the 2 or both to look for."
"The results will be divided into the types that were
specified using different tabs, and then the results will be orderable by different
categories, such as name, size, site, etc."
"In addition the user will have the option to filter out or only search certain
websites; for example a user may only want to look at videos on YouTube."
"They will
have the facility for users to store their favorite videos, so that they can come back
to the video at another time."
"The first will be the general user that
will be using our software to find their videos."
"They will be able to edit
which sites the system will search, depending on whether they think the site is safe,
compatible with our software, the speed at which the site can be searched, and how
useful the site is to us, i.e."
"The system will be portable; this means it will work across different operating
systems including Microsoft XP and Vista, Mac OS X and a range of Linux
platforms."
"The hardware needed for our system will be a reasonably up-to-date computer that
is connected to the internet via a modem."
"The user will give a search-term that will search through a database of compatible
torrent websites that are added by the development team."
"User ticks torrent tick box – system will now query the torrent websites in its
database when a search is started."
"Results for this query will then be
sent to the torrent tab in the program where they will display information such as
website, seeds, peers, size, date posted and a link for the webpage."
"User sorts the search results by clicking once on a column header – system sorts all
results by descending/ascending order."
"User clicks on next page button – system displays the next set of results for the
search."
"REQ-1:
Torrent search will share the same search bar with the streaming search."
"REQ-2:
Database of torrent sites can be updated via the internet."
"REQ-3:
There will be a tick box to allow the user to choose to include torrent
searching in the search."
"REQ-5:
If no results are found on a search it will display a message “No results were
found for this search.”"
"REQ-7:
There will be page button for the user to navigate the results."
"User ticks streaming host tick box – system will now query the video hosting sites in
its database when a search is started."
"User ticks streaming links tick box – system will now query the video link sites in its
database when a search is started."
"The hosting half of the tab displays the
website, full video name, length and date posted."
"User sorts the search results by clicking once on the column header – system sorts
all results by descending/ascending order."
"User filters websites they want to be shown in the results – system removes
unselected websites from the results."
"User clicks on next page button – system displays the next set of results for the
search."
"REQ-1:
Streaming search will share the same search bar with the torrent search."
"REQ-3:
There will be a tick box to allow the user to choose to include video host
searching in the search."
"REQ-4:
There will be a tick box to allow the user to choose to include video link
searching in the search."
"REQ-7:
If no results are found on a search it will display a message “No results were
found for this search.”"
"REQ-9:
There will be page button for the user to navigate the results."
"The user Interface will consist of one main screen, allowing all the functionally to
come from this one screen."
"This allows the user to use the software with ease by
not flicking through a number of different screens."
"In addition to this the user can
always see the videos they are looking for."
"We decided on this
type of interface because we felt that it would be very simple for the user to
navigate."
"From our reports we found that the simpler the interface was, the more
people liked it."
"With all these features complied into one screen it will give the software more
flexibility and allows for easy and simple usage."
"The software will use hyperlinks to allow the user to open websites in their default
web browser."
"Communication standards that will be used through the software will be PHP or
other such languages."
"These will be used to query the different servers that the
websites use and will give us back"
"REQ-1:
Query times will take no longer than 5 seconds to any website."
"REQ-2:
Sending the hyperlink to the default browser will take less than 1 second."
"REQ-3:
Loading the program will take less than 10 seconds."
"REQ-7:
Any torrent result with a rating of less than 1 will not be displayed."
"Our development team must thoroughly investigate each website within our
database each month, to ensure that no illegal or harmful content is exposed to our
users."
"While all safety measures resulting from the site may not be fully identified, a
recommendation of a full legal review of the software should be undertaken before
the site is available to the public."
"The system we produce will stay within all the legal requirements on our behalf, as
our software is only listing links for video streams and video download, and this is
not illegal."
In the next version we will consider adding a system to also search UseNet Binaries.
