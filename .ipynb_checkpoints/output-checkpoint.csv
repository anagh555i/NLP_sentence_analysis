"The goal of the SRS is to provide a functional tool for 
guiding the development of controls and data acquisition systems in a manner consistent with their operation within the Gemini System.",The SRS helps develop control and data systems for Gemini.
"As such, it logically follows the Operational Concepts document, which addresses the control of the Gemini system from a more general 
perspective.",It follows the Operational Concepts document.
"This is the on-site person responsible for monitoring the data acquisition
and validating the data integrity being collected for the astronomer, as well as ensuring
that the science plan is functioning to the needs of the astronomer.",This person checks data and makes sure it's correct for the astronomer.
"This person
is responsible for ensuring the integrity of the system and for keeping the system functioning
accurately during observations.",This person keeps the system working correctly.
"The Telescope Operator works with the Observer and
the science plan to produce as good data as is possible.",Telescope Operator makes good data with help.
"They work with other users to determine
appropriate observation scheduling changes, maintenance down-time, and system
modifications.","They work with others to decide on schedules, downtime, and changes."
"It is possible that a particular individual would fall into several of the
categories.",Someone might fit into multiple groups.
"For example, it is not unusual for the astronomer to also be the science
observer.",Astronomers are often science observers too.
"The Gemini system, when powered on, exists in one of several disjoint operational 
levels.",Gemini is on or off.
"This is a special, read-only case of the observing mode that can be
invoked on a subsystem basis.",This is a special case for reading only.
"It is normally available only to the Telescope
Operator and the science program sequencer when at operation level.",Only operators and scientists use it when working.
"Actual
access to the telescope is not permitted in this mode, but the virtual telescope capability of
the Gemini system provides a telescope simulator that is useful for planning observations,
as are on-line databases.","You can't use the real telescope now, but you can use a fake one to plan what you want to see and look up information online."
"Under no circumstances should testing affect the performance
of an ongoing observation.",Don't let testing ruin an ongoing observation.
"It is possible to inquire about system utilization, efficiency, etc.",You can ask about how well a system works.
"No control is available in this mode, only status and scheduling
information is accessible.","No control is available, just info on status and schedules."
"It is entirely possible for a single user to be accessing the system through several modes
simultaneously.",One person can use the system in many ways at once.
"In fact, this is the typical situation with the Telescope Operator, who is
often concurrently accessing the system through the observer, monitor, and operator
modes.",The Telescope Operator usually uses the system at the same time in three ways.
"There are times when an astronomer might be using both observer and monitor
modes.",Astronomer uses both modes.
"It is from here that nightly operations
would take place.","Here is the rewritten sentence:

Operations happen here at night."
This is the facility where off duty personnel reside while stationed on the summit.,People live here when they are not working at the top.
"This would be the Hale Pohaku facility on Mauna Kea and Cerro Tololo in Chile
(assuming no support facility is constructed on Cerro Pachon).",Hale Pohaku is on Mauna Kea and Cerro Tololo.
"This is the facility where offices, shops, etc.",This place has offices and stores.
"These are super sites, in general located in partner countries, which have direct links
to the telescopes via communications lines.",These sites connect to telescopes directly.
"Although they have remote operations capability, the link capacity will determine
at what level.",Link capacity decides that level.
"Unless the contrary is explicitly stated, all requirements and modes presented are
intended to be available to all users of the system.",All users can use everything unless it's said otherwise.
"It should also be noted that what the system has to guarantee in terms of operations
must fulfill all possible requirements, but it does not mean that all features will be
made available to all users at all locations at all times.","The system must do everything needed, but this doesn't mean everyone gets everything everywhere."
"The available capabilities will have to be adapted to the operational needs both
locally and remotely and these decisions can only be taken later in the life of the
project.","Capabilities must adapt to project needs locally and remotely, with decisions made later."
"Purpose of work
Whatever their level of experience, observing astronomers will wish to concentrate
on the efficient acquisition of astronomical data and on-line assessment of data quality,
rather than on the details of controlling the telescope and instruments.",Astronomers focus on getting good data quickly.
"To allow observing astronomers to achieve this objective, the system must offer to a
user an interface which, while fulfilling the various operational requirements in the
different modes and offering status information both automatically and on request at
any required level, is still simple to learn and secure in its use.","The system should be easy to learn and safe to use, with a simple interface that shows important info."
"Privileges
Observing astronomers shall have no privileges as far as the direct control of the telescope
is concerned.",Astronomers won't control telescopes.
"They shall not be able to send control commands directly but they must be
able to enquire about the status of the telescope or any subsystem at any time.",They can't send direct commands but can ask about the telescope's status anytime.
"The intent is
not to restrict the capabilities of the observing astronomer in any way but rather to establish
a single point of control and responsibility.","Don't limit what astronomers can do, just make one person in charge."
"Programs, as opposed to observers, may
have the capability of direct control of the telescope.",Programs can control telescopes directly.
"This would allow the observer to create
an observing program which requested a telescope control function but would not
allow the observer to enter (for instance) a command to slew the mount.","Allow observer to make request for telescope control, but not to move mount."
"This is essential to support operational requirements such as service observing
and flexible scheduling (as defined later in Section 2.7 on page 2-12).",This supports operations like watching and flexible timing.
"A certain degree of interaction shall be provided, meaning in this case that the user will
interact with the scheduler program, rather than with the control programs directly.",User interacts with scheduler program.
It must also be possible to break and resequence this queue.,Break and resequence this queue.
"In particular, Operations staff will be able to enable direct interactive operation, but this
shall not be considered as the normal operation mode for the reasons explained in
Section 2.7 on page 2-12.","Operations staff can do it directly, but that's not usual."
"It is evident that, for some functions (such as adjustment of
spectrograph slit width for seeing conditions) it must be necessary to include interactive
capability.",Some functions need interactive capability.
"Only after experience has been gained with the
system will the existence of the queue become evident to the on site observer.","After using it, you'll see a line."
"Depending on the operations implemented on the Gemini 8m Telescopes, they may
become telescope operators, operations supervisors of the Gemini 8m Telescopes telescope,
and instrument operators and have to overview the Gemini 8m Telescopes operation.",They become operators or supervisors depending on their job.
"They will supervise telescope operation and will
be able to advise observing astronomers on what they have to do to use telescope and
instruments efficiently.",They will help with telescope use and give advice on how to use it well.
"Privileges
Operations staff shall have privileges to access all commands and maintenance procedures
in case of problems.",Staff can use all commands and fix things if there are problems.
"However, they shall not have access to subsystems while these are in normal operation.",They won't use subsystems when they're working normally.
"If they need to access other parts of the system appropriate reconfiguration procedures
have to be run.",They must run reconfiguring procedures if needed.
"Operation mode
Operations staff shall have access to operation tables in update mode, while observing
astronomers will have access to them only in read mode (for example the list of
filters mounted on an instrument).",Staff can see tables. Astronomers can only look at lists.
"Again, the intent is not to restrict the capabilities of
the observing astronomer in any way but rather to establish a single point of control
and responsibility.","We want to let astronomers do their job freely, but we need one person in charge."
"At the present time it is not clear how to handle visitor instrument
requirements in this area.",We don't know how to deal with visitors' instruments here.
"They shall be able to change the operational status of units according to the results of
tests performed on such units (e.g.",They can change unit status based on test results.
"to see if a faulty unit can be declared as operational
again and redefined as part of the environment in use).",Check if broken thing can work again.
"Definition
Software development and maintenance are staff:
•based either at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site or base facility, or
•based at the Gemini 8m Telescopes remote operations facility, or
•non Gemini staff from a contract company or from an associated Institute.",Software development and maintenance are done by people who work either on-site or remotely.
"These users will have a deep understanding of the way the Gemini 8m Telescopes
software works.",They know how to use Gemini 8m software.
"Purpose of work
Software development and maintenance staff intervene when there is a major problem
to be solved or an upgrade to be installed.",Staff fix big problems or install updates.
"Privileges
Software development and maintenance staff need the highest privilege in order to be able
to modify everything in the system.",Staff need high privileges to change everything.
"Nevertheless strict configuration control guidelines
must be followed to prevent interference with ongoing normal operation.",Follow rules to avoid problems.
"Operation mode
Software development and maintenance staff usually work at the test level 
(see Section 3.2.1.3 on page 3-4) for the part of the software under test.",Work at test level.
"Other parts of the Gemini 8m Telescopes may also need to run in test mode
 to support integration tests.",Other parts may need to run in test mode for testing.
"This means that a number of commands are available 
which allow the hardware concerned to be tested 
(test commands) and are not accessible to observing astronomers.",Some test commands exist for testing hardware but are hidden from astronomers.
"This section derives directly from Gemini 8m Telescopes program requirements 
and speciﬁes the operational context, which is a direct consequence of the structure of the Gemini 8m Telescopes system.",This comes from Gemini 8m Telescopes and says what it does in its own way.
The Gemini 8m Telescopes operation has to cope with a complex environment produced by:,Gemini 8m Telescopes must deal with a complicated situation.
"Although there are two telescopes as part of the 
Gemini system there are no plans to support concurrent use 
of them as if they were a single facility.",There is only one Gemini telescope at a time.
"It is, however, a long term goal 
of the Gemini project to be capable of being used in conjunction with nearby, 
perhaps non-Gemini, telescopes on the same site (for instance for interferometry).",The goal is to use it with other telescopes.
"Parallel access to all the mounted instruments shall be provided, though only 
one instrument has access to the telescope beam (active instrument).Instruments 
which feed two detectors by using beam splitters or ﬁeld splitters is considered as a 
single active instrument.","Access all instruments at the same time, but only one can use the special beam."
"Feeding two separate instruments via beam splitters or 
ﬁeld splitters and providing separate control nodes is not a requirement.",You don't need to feed two instruments separately.
they shall be able to take calibration or ﬂat ﬁeld exposures in parallel,They can do both kinds of photos at once.
"they shall be able to prepare for an exposure to start as soon as the telescope beam is switched back 
to them (in this case, they are in a hot standby situation)",They can get ready when the telescope beam turns back on.
"they shall be able to work; at all foreseen operation levels 
(observing, maintenance, test) (see Section 3.2.1 on page 3-3).","They can work at any level of operation (observe, maintain, test)."
"Regardless of the status of an inactive instrument, it shall not be possible for any of its permitted 
actions to adversely impact the active instrument",It can't harm the working one.
Due to the specialized nature of visitor instrumentation it is unlikely that complete integration into the Gemini environment is either feasible or warranted.,It's hard to integrate visitor instruments with Gemini because they are special.
"The Gemini Telescopes view all instruments as operating as servers, responding to commands from the upper levels of the system.",Gemini Telescopes see instruments as servers that respond to orders.
Visitor instruments must be capable of operating in this mode to be adequately supported.,Visitor instruments must work here.
"maintenance of operations tables (such as ﬁlter lists) which
 can become part of an observation's permanent record",Maintenance of operation tables becomes part of a record.
"Due to the nature of visitor instrumentation it is unlikely that 
more complicated functionality can be supported.",It's hard to add complex features.
"This does not mean that more complicated functionality will not be 
possible for visitor instruments that require it.",More complex features can still be used by visitors who need them.
"As more complicated functionality 
will be supported via standardized interfaces for the Gemini instruments, such 
as coordinated motions, it should be possible to adapt visitor instruments to this 
standard.",More functions will work with Gemini instruments.
"The difﬁculty with offering such services as an externally supported standard, 
as opposed to an internally supported standard, is that decisions to change internal 
standards do not impact external users.",Changing internal standards doesn't affect people outside.
"It is important that the visitor instrument interface be stable and long-lived, as the 
time between successive uses of the same visitor instrument can be as long as one or two years.",The visitor instrument should stay stable for a long time.
"The support of visitor instrumentation is made simpler if the visitor equipment 
adheres to the Gemini standards.",Visitor equipment should follow Gemini standards.
"the evolution of Gemini standards might require existing visitor instruments 
to rewrite or rework large areas of their control system",Gemini standards may need to change some parts of their control system.
"visitor instruments built later in time than the initial complement of 
Gemini instruments may want to take advantage of different and/or less
 expensive technology if it better suits the goals of their project",Visitor can use newer technology if it's cheaper and helps their project.
"For these reasons it is probably not possible to establish a combined standard to which all instruments, 
both Gemini and visitor, adhere to completely.",It's hard to make one standard for all instruments.
"It is much better to establish a subset of Gemini facilities which will be
 made available to visitor instruments via long lived, stable interfaces.",Make Gemini interfaces for visitors.
"The requirements to have instruments operated as single units 
imply that several user stations will be active at the same time on the Gemini 
8m Telescopes.",Several users will use Gemini telescopes at the same time.
"Independently of the location of users at the telescope site, they shall be able to access
 (according to their privileges) any part of the whole setup with a simple logon and conﬁguration operation.",Users can access everything with one login.
"By this it 
is meant that, while some (active) user is in control of the Gemini 8m Telescopes, someone 
else can follow what they are doing by monitoring all the relevant data from telescope and 
instruments.",Someone else can see what's happening when someone uses the Gemini 8m Telescopes.
"All other users wishing 
to monitor Gemini 8m Telescopes operations have to go through the procedures set up by 
Operations and get permission to do so.",Other users must follow Operations' rules to watch Gemini 8m Telescopes work.
"The multi-point monitoring mode might also be important when certain difﬁcult or rare problems 
occur, when expert advice is needed and can only be obtained from colleagues situated remotely.",Some hard problems need help from experts far away.
"Multi-point monitoring allows them to follow directly the results of tests performed and 
investigate how the system is working (e.g.",They track test results and see how the system works.
"Multi-point monitoring also allows a local observer to be monitored and advised by a remote 
supervisor.",A local observer can be watched and helped by someone far away.
".There is a visual user interface to the OCS to allow for changes to the viewing 
program.",OCS has a visual interface for changing the view.
It is possible to have more than one station participate in the observing.,More stations can join.
"It is therefore an essential requirement
 that telescope operation is supported by the software in a smooth and very friendly way 
in this mode.",The software should be easy to use.
"Interaction will normally be via an automatic sequencer 
(see Section 2.5.9 on page 2-6).",Interaction is usually done automatically.
"This is clearly a top priority requirement and one 
which will have to be realized before implementing any other mode.",This must happen first.
"The initial implementation 
of the automatic sequencer will operate in a “pass through”mode where
 all commands are accepted and transmitted with
 minimal checking and delay.",The first version of this machine will just send commands as they come.
"Queue-based observing is the primary observation mode used with the Gemini 
telescopes, as it is the best means of providing sound science data while maximizing 
efﬁcient use of the telescope.",Gemini telescopes mostly use queue-based observing to get good science data quickly.
"While its requirements include all those given below for service 
observing, it has the following special requirements.",It has these special requirements.
"The observing program must be fully automated, requiring very little human 
interaction during the observation.",The program should work automatically with minimal human help.
"The means that the Gemini software must include 
a sufﬁciently rich programming environment to make this feasible.",Gemini needs a good coding space.
"In addition, this should 
be a visually-oriented environment providing a simple, 
easy-to-use interface to the astronomer.",This should be easy to use for astronomers.
"There should be a full telescope simulator to enable the astronomer
 to test observing programs for completeness, errors, and functionality.",Astronomers need a telescope simulator.
"There is a requirement for software to assist in object selection both 
within an observing program and across observing programs, in order to optimize 
observing efﬁciency.",Software helps choose objects quickly within or between programs.
"There must be software to support the ﬂexible scheduling, both 
manually and via a scheduler, allowing for the interleaving of observing 
programs in a manner that is transparent to the individual observing 
programs.",Software should help with flexible scheduling.
"This includes managing the collection of science, 
environmental, engineering, reference, and calibration data.","Manage science, environmental, engineering, reference, and calibration data."
"To maximize the use of the available observing time it must
 be possible to queue all of the observing that is possible with the
 currently available instruments.",Use all available instruments at once.
"It should be possible to resort 
the queue so that the next observation to take place comes to the front
 of the queue.",Move the next one to the front.
"This sorting will be based on properties of the individual 
observing sequences, current site conditions, and other rules established 
by the observatory directorate.While these rules have yet to be worked 
out one could imagine rules such as “no more than 15% of observing 
will be preempted” or “a 10% overhead to the prime observing project 
is acceptable in order to pick up observations in similar parts of the 
sky with identical ﬁlters”.","Sorting will be based on observer, site conditions and rules from the director."
"As the costs of implementing 
such a scheduler are currently difﬁcult to estimate it may prove 
necessary to implement it in a future phase of the project.",It's hard to know how much it will cost so we might do it later.
"The system design, 
if it does not include a scheduler, should speciﬁcally allow for its future 
implementation.",The system should be designed to make it easy to add a scheduler later.
All software should be developed to permit remote operations.,Software should allow remote control.
"It should 
be possible to do full operations remotely",Do it all from anywhere.
"Team observing, with multiple observers at different sites should 
be supported.",Team needs support.
It must be possible to restrict speciﬁc operations to speciﬁc remote sites.,Restrict certain actions to specific places.
"The method used to restrict such operations should be
independent of the operations themselves, and dynamic.",The method should be separate and changing.
It is assumed that the hardware involved in remote operations has been speciﬁed with sufﬁcient bandwidth to support remote operations.,The hardware for remote work has enough bandwidth.
"The choice of the name remote operations is meant to suggest an entire category of operations, such as remote observing but also remote access for diagnostic support.","The name ""remote operations"" means all kinds of operations like watching from a distance and fixing problems remotely."
"It is only necessary that the functionality of the system be transparent, it is accepted that the speed of the link will determine the perceived transparency of the system.",The system must be clear and its speed determines how clear it seems.
"It is required that the remote operations software be considered from the 
beginning in the Gemini 8m Telescopes software design, to avoid redesign later.",Consider remote operations software from start in Gemini 8m Telescopes design.
"This should reduce the amount of speciﬁc software needed for remote operations, 
as the common layers of software shall cope from the beginning with a 
distributed environment.",This reduces software needed for remote work.
"Remote control means that the function normally associated with a
 local Telescope Operator, that of entering telescope control commands, would be
 available from a remote site.",Control from far away.
"The philosophy
behind this is that, for safety considerations, telescope control commands cannot be issued 
without a staff member (not necessarily the same person) having direct access to:",Telescope control needs staff help.
"Remote observing means that users shall be able to observe from a
 remote site such as Cerro Tololo, Hilo or even home Institutes.","Users can watch from far away places like Cerro Tololo, Hilo or their own homes."
"This possibility 
has to be provided on the Gemini 8m Telescopes.",It has to be provided on Gemini 8m Telescopes.
"The extent to which realistic observing conditions can be reproduced depends,
 of course, largely on the link bandwidth available.",Bandwidth affects how well we can copy real-life conditions.
"Experience with previous 
telescopes at other
OBSERVING MODE REQUIREMENTS
observatories shows, however, that, even with very limited bandwidths, 
remote observing can be implemented, provided the software is suitable for this.",Previous telescopes show remote observing works even with slow internet.
"Remote observing, as meant in this context, does not mean remote control.",Remote observing is different from remote controlling.
"In the last case they will use a remote User interface to 
submit commands to the Gemini 8m Telescopes scheduler at the Gemini 
8m Telescopes site.",They will use a remote user interface to submit commands to the Gemini telescope scheduler.
"It is a requirement for the Gemini 8m Telescopes
operation and will complement service observing, making it friendlier for users.",This is a requirement for using Gemini 8m Telescopes.
"Remote 
monitoring coincides to a large 
extent with multipoint monitoring, 
but allows the remote user to “pick and choose” the information that is displayed
 on the remote screen.","Remote monitoring shows similar things as multipoint monitoring, but lets you pick what's shown on your screen."
"A remote observer might also need a real-time video and voice link with the operator
 in the control room, perhaps using a portable video camera which the operator can 
position as necessary.",The observer needs a live video and voice connection to the operator.
"It is assumed this facility is provided entirely by hardware, and 
is beyond the scope of the Gemini software.",Hardware provides this facility.
This might be necessary to back up local users expertise and to help in case of problems.,Back up user expertise for help with problems.
"Distributed access to the Gemini 8m Telescopes software, once implemented.",Access to Gemini telescopes is available now.
"Service observing implies that the Gemini staff 
are responsible for performing the actual data collection for the astronomer.",Gemini staff do the data collecting.
"A special case of service observing, queue-based, is given earlier, and assumes 
that the observing program can be executed with minimal interaction with the client 
astronomer.","A special case is shown first, where a program watches something and only needs to talk to an astronomer a little bit."
"The more general case, where a science observer is present on site and the client 
astronomer is remotely connected, is considered here.",A scientist is there in person and another astronomer is watching from far away.
"The observing program must be automated, requiring little human 
interaction during the observation.",The program should run automatically with minimal human help.
"The means that the Gemini software 
must include a sufﬁciently rich programming environment to make this feasible.",Gemini must have good coding tools.
"In addition, this should be a visually-oriented environment providing a simple, 
easy-to-use interface to the astronomer.",This is easy to use for astronomers.
"The programming environment should allow for the 
communication of special notes, instructions, and comments 
from the astronomer to the observer, possibly involving multimedia techniques.",The program should let astronomers send notes and comments to observers with pictures or videos.
"Observing, as such, is the purpose of the Gemini 8m Telescopes system.",The purpose is to observe.
"But interactive observing is perhaps, in some cases, not the most efﬁcient way to achieve 
this, although it will be necessary for certain kinds 
of observations (such as adaptive optics) and in certain phases (such as commissioning 
and test periods).",It's not always the best way to do this.
"Service observing, on the other hand, means that the observing 
program can be performed by someone other than the proposing
 astronomer.",Someone else can do it.
"It will be done on his behalf at a convenient moment 
that is not exactly predeﬁned and may be intermixed with programs from other users.",It will be done later when it's easy.
Service observing requires switching during the night among telescope modes and instruments.,Switch between modes and instruments at night while observing.
"This might typically be a few times (2) per night, when sky conditions change.",It happens twice a night when the weather changes.
"It requires also that the observing program is so well speciﬁed that it can be executed by 
someone else.",It must be clear enough to be run by someone else.
"Service observing requires a suitable organization to support it, and ﬁrst of all, considerable 
experience with a smooth running system.",Service needs good organization and experience with working well.
"For these reasons it can only be applied to the 
Gemini 8m Telescopes once the Classical observing requirement has been fulﬁlled and been 
in operation for a while.",It can only be used with Gemini 8m Telescopes after they have worked well for some time.
"Nevertheless, the software and data structures to support classical 
observing which have to be present in a system that is only interactive at the start might 
require considerable redesign to be adapted later to the service observing requirement",The software needs to change.
"To achieve efﬁcient service observing, queue observing, and ﬂexible scheduling, 
it should be possible to carry out observations automatically, in accordance with predeﬁned 
sequences of exposures, as is commonly done in space observatories.",Automatically do observations following a plan.
"This corresponds to what is meant by planned observing, which still requires competent 
monitoring at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site or remotely.","This matches what is meant by planned watching, needing good checking."
"At the same time, one does not want to lose the advantages and the extra
ﬂexibility of ground-based astronomy.",Don't lose benefits of ground-based astronomy.
"So whichever scheme is adopted to
perform automatic sequences, interaction shall be allowed at the desired 
level (for example, only on error conditions, 
any time the user is allowed to break a sequence, etc.",Let users interact when needed.
"It will require the use of service and/or remote observing, as 
users cannot stay around indeﬁnitely waiting for the conditions required by 
their program.",You need to observe remotely or use services because you can't wait forever.
"This can be complemented by remote monitoring, if users can be 
on standby at a suitably equipped remote site.",Users can stay at a remote site with equipment to help.
"Flexible scheduling requires the possibility to change telescope scheduling 
quickly, exchanging observing programs.",Change schedule quickly.
"This can be achieved only with the 
help of appropriate scheduling software, which must advise the operations team 
on the best choice to make which is compatible with the relative priorities of the 
various observing programs.",Software helps decide what to do next.
"It should be recognized that such ‘expert scheduling’ 
software does not currently exist - it should be a requirement of such software that 
it have an operational mode which merely supports the decision making process by 
presenting appropriate information.",Such expert scheduling software doesn't exist yet. It should show relevant info to help make decisions.
"Flexible scheduling requires switching during the night among telescope modes and 
instruments (typically 2 times per night).",Switch between modes and instruments at night.
"These requirements apply to the commands and replies 
between sub-systems (including status information requests and replies), 
information ﬂow to and from on-line databases, and commands 
and software for the IOCs.",These rules apply to all messages between systems.
"The syntax of control ﬂow commands is to be consistent 
across the system, whether accessing workstation software or IOC software.",Control flow commands should be the same everywhere.
"All subsystems must respond to a common set of commands 
to test operational status, inquiries as to version, perform self-tests, etc.",All systems must follow same orders.
"Handshaking of commands between IOCs must occur within 100-200 msec, 
signaling acceptance of each command.",IOCs accept commands quickly.

expected to be 100 TPS.",System expects 100 TPS.
"This assumes bridging between 
communication sections, to isolate trafﬁc in relevant sections only.",This isolates traffic in certain areas.
"For focusing and related activities, maximum acceptable detector readout time
 is about 0.1 sec, though only a portion of the detector may be read during that time.",Detector readout takes about 0.1 second.
"Since the Gemini system supports 
monitoring of operation, there must be the capability of providing multiple, 
simultaneous access to data.",Gemini lets you watch many things at once.
"Data transfer between the virtual telescope system and 
attached workstations therefore imposes signiﬁcant transfer requirements on the LAN.",Data transfer to computers is slow.
"Data is normally acquired as uncompressed data,
 but may be compressed using a loss-less compression technique for transmission 
from the Gemini system or across the system LAN.","Data is usually not compressed, but can be if needed."
"The goal of compression is to minimize 
bandwidth impact on the LAN and WAN and to save space on 
removable media.",Compress data to use less bandwidth and storage.
"For data that requires preprocessing, such as infrared detector data, 
only the preprocessed data is stored.",Only preprocessed data is stored.
"Data from all instruments and detectors is stored as compressed
 data, using a standard format.",Data is stored compressed.
"There is a ﬁrst level of storage within IOCs, to secure data in the event of 
link failures.A second level of storage is on the Gemini system data disk(s), possibly
 also on removable media.",Data is stored in two places: one place is inside IOCs and another place is on a special computer disk.
"Quick-look data quality assessment is 
done using this level.",This level does quick look data quality assessments.
"Data is transmitted between Gemini and home Institutes
 using a FITS format and contains all header information provided with the data.",Data goes from Gemini to homes in a special way that includes all details.
"The system data capacity is capable of retaining 7 days of data produced by the largest 
instrument, the last 3 days of which must be available interactively from hard disk or 
similar medium.",System can keep 7 days of data. Last 3 days are available on hard disk.
"To preserve the integrity of the system, there must be a system of privileges 
established at each operating level of the system.",System needs rules at every level.
"Protection against accidental interference is to be implemented using an Access Mode Allocation 
system that dynamically identiﬁes and assigns resources as needed.",Protect against mistakes by using a system that gives out resources when needed.
"Critical resources 
(those that can support only a restricted number of simultaneous uses) are assigned solely 
through this allocation system.",Limited resources are given out through this system.
"The allocation system must ensure that the system cannot 
remain deadlocked with respect to this resource allocation.",The system must not get stuck.

and codify common tasks.",Make procedures simple and clear.
The tasks that require such procedures include:,Those need special steps.

operation.",Don't disturb the telescope.
"Instrument self-testing and self-diagnosis This is not permitted to interfere with 
telescope operation",Don't let instrument testing stop telescope work.
"The control software should know what subsystems are installed

facilities to verify Gemini 8m Telescopes system and Gemini 8m Telescopes software 
performances.",Telescope and software will have tests to check its performance.
"Every Gemini 8m Telescopes software module shall have corresponding test speciﬁcations 
to check normal operation of releases, to be used both for acceptance tests and as an on-line 
test procedure.",Gemini 8m Telescopes software modules need test specifications to check they work normally.
Subsystems must notify the user when faults occur.,Subsystems tell users when they fail.
"This notiﬁcation must be 
speciﬁc as to origin and problem.",This notice must say where it's from and what's wrong.
"It may also prove useful to have multiple levels of fault notiﬁcation such as detailed, 
verbose, short, etc.",Have different kinds of fault notices.
"one detector, one instrument) predeﬁned 
procedures must exist to redeﬁne the environment in such a way that operation can 
restart with the remaining equipment.",One detector and one instrument need procedures to restart work with what's left.
"In case of computer hardware failure concerning the user station equipment, it shall 
be possible to transfer control from one user station to another via a simple software 
reconﬁguration procedure.","If computer hardware fails, you can switch to another computer using a simple process."
"In this case there shall be 
a procedure to replace faulty cards and/or assemblies.",Replace bad parts.
"If it is possible to observe with that 
particular IOC in a failed state (in general, this is limited to IOCs that are associated with 
individual scientiﬁc instruments) then it must be possible to reconﬁgure the system 
to do so.","If you can see something with that IOC when it fails, you should be able to make it work again."
"Full redundancy is not a requirement of the Gemini 8m Telescopes and it will 
be acceptable to have to replace units in case of failure.","No need for backup, we can just replace if something breaks."
"There are subsystems which are relatively inexpensive to support as redundant systems, 
such as telescope control computers.",Some things cost less to back up with extra copies.
"For each area where redundancy is decided to be cost 
effective, procedures for switching to the backup system will be established.","For areas where it's cheaper, we'll set up plans to switch to a backup system."
"All communication shall be based on the use of standard communication protocols, where 
retry procedures are applied (a form of software redundancy) as part of the protocol.",Communication uses standard rules and tries again if needed.
"Certain network concepts may be preferable as they offer intrinsic redundancy 
(e.g.",Some networks are better because they have built-in backup.

operating in.",Gemini subsystems must have a simulator and user interface.
"All Gemini software is to be fully documented, internally with appropriate comments, 
and external documentation.",Gemini software must have full notes inside and outside.
"It is likely that different user interface modules (see above) would present 
different portions of this functionality to the user.",Different parts show different things.
"The version information is to be retrievable from executing 
software via control commands.",Get version info by running software with special commands.
"Also, the use of a virtual-telescope model in the Gemini system means that 
the integrated system can be tested and developed independently of the target hardware.",The system can be tested and developed without the real equipment.
"Therefore all hardware subsystems must provide a software
 simulation module (as stated earlier) that responds in reasonable fashion to commands 
directed at that hardware.",Hardware must have a software simulator that works well with commands.
".Gemini subsystem should be as self-contained and autonomous as possible, 
thereby decreasing the functional width of the interface 
to the rest of the Gemini system.",Gemini subsystem should be independent and small.
"To achieve this, many other data concerning the telescope and instruments (parameters) 
and control commands will have to be exchanged between different processing units in 
order to setup and control telescope and instruments.",Data about the telescope and instruments must be shared between computers to set up and use them.
"Control information must be transferred, typically in the form of commands 
and replies from users, to telescope and instruments.",Control info goes to telescopes and instruments.
"No request for information shall produce a delay
 of control activities or locking, even if the corresponding equipment is not available or faulty.",No delay happens.
"Delay times for the exchange of control information must stay within precise time limits 
to be deﬁned in “General Description” in Chapter 2.",Delay times must fit within specific time limits defined in Chapter 2.
"One can afford to retransmit commands 
in case of transmission error or collision, but the protocol has to be predictable in that
 commands cannot get lost and replies have to come back reliably.","Commands can be sent again if there's a mistake, but the system must work correctly so messages don't get lost and answers come back okay."
"It is explicitly required that all such information is available to the Gemini 8m Telescopes 
software and is capable of being available to all users of the Gemini 8m Telescopes, subject 
only to restrictions with respect to updating.",All info must be available to Gemini 8m software and users.
"It must also be possible to restrict user access 
to such information.",Access can be limited.
"Detector data must be acquired and stored in the most effective way technology
 will allow; effectiveness should be evaluated in terms of cost, space requirements, longevity, 
and speed.",Data must be saved in a good way that uses available technology.
"This shall lead to the deﬁnition of a Gemini 8m Telescopes standard, used on all 
instruments.",This will define a standard for Gemini 8m Telescopes used by all instruments.
"In general, operational overheads must be kept as low as possible, to maximize 
actual observing times.",Keep overheads low to get more time.
"However, there must be at least two
copies - one to secure data as acquired and one to do assessment of data quality on-line 
(this last copy preferably on removable media).",There must be at least two copies - one for safekeeping and one for checking data quality.
"The link chosen to transfer data should 
represent as small a bottleneck as possible for data acquisition.",Make the link small so it doesn't slow down data getting.
"There might, however, be cases (for example, infrared detectors) where fast preprocessing is 
needed and where, therefore, raw data will not be stored
 as such, but in a preprocessed format.",Data won't be stored raw sometimes.
"Astronomical data will have to be transported between GEMINI and 
the home institutes of visiting astronomers in FITS format (as deﬁned by NOST 100-1.0,
 “Deﬁnition of the Flexible Image Transport System (FITS)”, NASA Science Ofﬁce of Standards
 and Technology).",Astronomical data will be sent between GEMINI and home institutes in FITS format.

which deﬁne the status of the system and / or control the system.",Each level has rules that show the system's state or control it.
It is anticipated that all user categories have access to this level.,All users can use this level.

 all non-protected parameter values, i.e.",Update all non-protected values.
"Privileges and protections are also important parameters
 to deﬁne user operations.",User operations need defining parameters.
"For example some users might only be allowed monitoring, as 
a subsystem is in use by someone else.",Some users can only monitor because someone else uses it.
"Protections must also be enforced (see also Security in Section 3.5.6
 on page 3- 20) among users and the operational software should indicate clearly
 to users the current operation level and check the compatibility between subsystems
 in different modes.",Protect users and software must show what's happening now and make sure parts work together.
"The capacity of the system can be expressed in terms of nodes, which is deﬁned 
as the number of workstations, or in terms of users, which is deﬁned as the sum total of users 
at all the nodes.",The system's capacity is measured by the number of workstations or users.
"When the Gemini 8m Telescopes telescope is used in its normal observing mode, there will be 
a single operator node for the telescope and two data acquisition and instrument control nodes.",One person controls one big eye that looks at stars.
"OPERATION
Some tests might be run in parallel on instruments that do not have the light beam at that 
moment, so in principle additional nodes might be working at the same time.",Tests can happen at the same time on different machines.
"The system will provide for a 
single off-site data acquisition and instrument control node - to be located at either the 
Gemini 8m Telescopes Site Support or Base Facility.",The system will have one special computer at either the Gemini site or base facility.
"One supervisor will monitor the system, and other users might need to monitor the running 
of observing programs, locally or remotely.",One person watches the system. Others may watch it too.
"As a conclusion, the Gemini 8m Telescopes control software shall allow simultaneous operation 
of up to six active control nodes and up to two more monitoring nodes (one local and one remote) without 
appreciable degradation of performance.",The software lets you use up to six controllers and two monitors at the same time without slowing down.
"In practice the operation and facilities foreseen so far for the Gemini 8m Telescopes will limit 
this number to a maximum in the order of three active nodes, but the Gemini 8m Telescopes 
computers and software shall be capable of coping with the load of 10 active nodes, should the 
case arise",The operation will only allow up to 3 active nodes.
"This section is intentionally kept at the level of performance criteria rather than 
response times (found in Section 2.11.2 on page 2- 22).",This section has performance standards not response times.
"There must be automatic procedures to implement startup and shutdown of the 
telescope and instruments.",Telescopes and instruments should start and stop automatically.

reasons that, in spite of the obvious differences of the setups and commands available, the 
same philosophy is applied throughout.",Same rules apply everywhere.
"This calls for a homogeneous user interface, which can be achieved only by applying the same 
user interface tools to the whole project, providing the Gemini 8m Telescopes user 
interface's ‘look and feel’.",Use same tools everywhere.
"Given the 
requirement to be able to access the Gemini 8m Telescopes from several points, the user 
interface should rather be seen as a package to be callable from a large number of stations, 
depending on where a user is.",Access Gemini telescopes from many places.
"It should also be network transparent so that it does not matter 
where it is being run.",It doesn't matter where it's run.

Telescopes software.",Avoid duplicate software and simplify Gemini 8m Telescopes software.
"Microprocessor software in particular tends to contain hardware speciﬁc 
software, though one should try to keep it as hardware independent as possible, isolating 
different software layers.","Microprocessor software has special parts for the computer's hardware, but it's best to make it work with any hardware and separate different parts of the software."
"The standard software must be adequate for the real-time requirements and must offer drivers 
to the standard electronics to be used on all the Gemini 8m Telescopes software subsystems 
and instruments.",The software must work well in real-time and connect with all Gemini 8m Telescopes' parts.
"There is also software which, although it will be interfaced to the Gemini 8m Telescopes, 
is referred to as external.",There is other software that is not part of the telescope.
"In order to make efﬁcient use of the telescope, to support different observing 
modes, and to support the versatility requirements, some form of on-line image (or pixel) 
quick-look analysis is required.",Use a quick look at images while using the telescope.

of the astronomical data as it comes in.,As it comes in.
"Advanced pipeline procedures might make this feasible, 
at least for observations of a standard nature.”","Advanced methods can do it, at least for normal observations."
"A prerequisite for this is that acquired data are 
made available as directly as possible in a common format, and that all additional data related
to an exposure and logging information are made available on-line at the same time.",Data must be shared quickly in the same way and online at the same time.
"Quick-look should be usable within exposure sequences to provide results and feedback 
parameters to the control software in a programmed way, without the need for manual 
intervention.",Quick-look should work automatically during sequences.
"This document does not try to be speciﬁc about the requirements for Quick-look 
other than that it should be synchronous.",This document says only one thing about Quick-look: it must be synchronous.
"remove instrument and observatory effects so the observer can make decisions 
about further observing actions).",Remove interference so you can decide what to do next.
"EXTERNAL INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS
It should also be noted that some Gemini 8m Telescopes subsystems, such as adaptive optics, 
may require their own special on-line pixel processing software, which is better deﬁned in the 
requirements for those subsystems.",Some parts of the telescope need special computer programs to work properly.
"The same situation might also occur with other instruments, where speciﬁc observer support 
software has to be foreseen for on-line use.",Other instruments may need special software too.
"In all these cases the speciﬁc on-line (quick-look) software development shall be seen as a 
subset of the development for the off-line data reduction system, to avoid as far as possible 
duplication of development effort.","All cases use online software development, which is part of offline data reduction system development to avoid repeating work."
"As comparisons with previous data might be of great value and affect the actual observing 
program, on-line interactive access to the data archiving system should exist, so that access 
to this database is possible for Gemini 8m Telescopes users.",Access to archived data should be available online for Gemini 8m Telescope users.
"; the amount 
of a speciﬁc exposure available; header only, averaged exposure, complete raw data set; and the 
time frame within which such data will be made available; same night, weekly, after proprietary 
period; will be established by the Gemini Archiving Requirements.","The amount of specific exposure available, average exposure, full data set, and time frame for sharing data will be decided."
"Computer access to star catalogues is also required, so that an automatic selection of candidate 
guide and standard stars can be made.",Computer needs access to star catalogs to pick guide and standard stars.
"The Gemini 8m Telescopes software must be able to interface with all commercial 
software packages available on the Gemini 8m Telescopes and integrated into the 
Gemini 8m Telescopes operation.",The software must work with all other software.
"A relevant example of such a package is a general database management system (DBMS), where 
operational information such as schedules, logs, problem reports and maintenance information 
related to various pieces of equipment should be kept.Being in itself a distributed telescope 
system and having a large number of instruments, the Gemini 8m Telescopes

"Being in itself a distributed telescope system and having a large number of 
instruments, the Gemini 8m Telescopes system has internal communication needs.",The Gemini 8m Telescopes system has many instruments and needs to talk to itself.
"This LAN shall be supplemented with a Local Time Bus, for distribution of absolute and 
relative time signals, and both a digital reﬂective memory bus and an analog event-based bus, 
for distribution of signals with requirements not satisﬁed by a LAN.",This LAN will get extra buses to send time and other signals.
"This layer could be considered as internal to a given subsystem 
or instrument, but as more than one subsystem might need it, one should aim for a unique 
solution at the hardware and software level.","This layer is part of one system or tool, but if many systems use it, we should make it unique."
"No distinction is made here between WAN and point to point links as there 
shall be no difference in the software between the two cases.",No difference is made between WAN and point-to-point links.
"However the system 
architecture will be designed so as to minimize the communication load placed on peer
 and higher level networks.",The system architecture is designed to reduce network traffic.
"The reason for repeating them here is to have a complete 
view of the required network functionality.To eliminate conceptual access problems, while 
coping with different bandwidths, LAN and WAN interfaces shall be homogeneous and shall 
be based on standards which allow migration on different media, should they become required 
during the Gemini 8m Telescopes project life.",We need to see all parts of the network so we can understand how it works.
"For maintenance reasons and hardware independence, a clear hierarchical model must be 
implemented, supporting separation of logical and physical layers, e.g.",A clear model is needed for maintenance and to separate different parts.
It is recognized that this hierarchy may need to be violated for (in general) performance reasons.,This hierarchy can be broken sometimes for speed.
"Network redundancy should also be considered in the design phase as a way to increase 
reliability and security, in particular for control information.",Network redundancy helps make it reliable and secure.
"Peer-to-peer connectivity should only be used to overcome a demonstrated 
performance problem.",Use peer-to-peer only when needed.
"It is envisaged that observing astronomers who have travelled to the Gemini 
8m Telescopes site will make use of the Gemini 8m Telescopes control room facilities.",Astronomers at the Gemini Telescopes will use the control room.
"This will allow centralized support and coordination of their operations, providing both 
operations support for individual instruments and supervision for all of them.",This helps control everything together.
"To allow coordination both locally
 at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site between the various users and with remote users, the 
software shall support access to the system from any user station.",The software lets anyone use it from anywhere.
"It will then be an operational
 decision, implying privileges and priorities for the various categories of users, and deﬁnition 
of what a given user can actually do.",It will decide who gets special powers and what they can do.
"Although some of these constraints may appear redundant 
the project recognizes that:",Some constraints are repeated.
"during the next 5 to 10 years new hardware will be available with features and costs 
that could beneﬁt the project",New hardware will come soon with better features and lower cost.
"the cost of maintaining an existing hardware standard, even if available, may 
exceed the costs of adopting a new hardware standard",Maintaining old hardware can be more expensive than switching to new one.
"These constraints recognize that the majority of the expense in changing
 hardware standards is the cost of the software.",Most expenses come from software when changing hardware standards.
"Computers used at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site, particularly in the test phase
 when they are outside the control room and near the subsystem under test, shall be checked 
against altitude and humidity speciﬁcations for the Gemini 8m Telescopes site 
(see also [EDS] in Section 1.3).",Computers used at the Gemini site must meet altitude and humidity standards when outside the control room.

under state conditions” or “The probability that an item can perform its intended function for 
a speciﬁed interval under stated conditions”.",Something works correctly without breaking for a certain time.
"The [GSR] sets as a requirement 2% and a goal 1% 
for total system (mechanical, electrical, and software) downtime due to failures - this translates 
to a maximum of 15 minutes per night or 1 night per month of downtime.","The goal is 1% downtime, which means no more than 15 minutes each night or one night each month."

cause of the problem) and the system shall put itself into a safe state, whenever a safety aspect 
might be involved.","If recovery fails, report the error clearly and make the system safe if it's related to safety."

subsystem.To increase software robustness, range checking and validity checking shall be 
supported before execution of any input command.",The system should be able to change its own settings so it can keep working even if one small part fails. It should also check the commands it gets to make sure they are correct before doing them.

passively interlocked.",All dangers that can cause death or damage must be stopped automatically.
"All hazards capable of causing injury and/or severe damage to equipment shall be 
actively 
interlocked (severe damage implies that repairs are not repairable at the depot level","All hazards can hurt people or break things, so fix them."

"Within the EPICS community there is understood to be an informal distinction between 
two classes of developers, labeled ‘Internals’ and ‘Applications’.",EPICS has two kinds of developers: Internals and Applications.
"Although these deﬁnitions
 are nowhere written down, this understanding serves as the basis for many 
discussions with the community and for the nature of training classes.",These definitions aren't written down but help us talk to each other and teach.
"Note: The bulk of this section is taken from the EPICS document
 ‘EPICS Overview’.",This section comes from an EPICS overview document.

from which a control system can be created.",EPICS has parts that make a control system.
"This is a UNIX based workstation which can run
 various EPICS tools.",This runs Unix and EPICS tools.
"This is VME/VXI based chassis containing a Motorola 68xxx processor, 
various I/O modules, and VME modules that provide access to other
 I/O buses such as GPIB.","This has a Motorola processor, some input/output parts, and lets you connect to other devices."
"This is the communication network which allows the   IOCs and OPIs
 to communicate.",Network lets IOCs and OPIs talk.
"EPICS provides a software component, Channel Access, which
 provides network transparent communication between a Channel Access client
 and an arbitrary number of Channel Access servers.",EPICS has a part that lets computers talk to each other over the network.
"The ﬁrst ﬁeld of every database record holds the record name, which
 must be unique across all IOCs attached to the same TCP/IP subnet.",First field has a special name that is unique for each group.
A number of data structures are provided so that the database can be accessed efﬁciently.,Some data structures help access the database quickly.
"Most software components, because they access the database via database access
 routines, do not need to be aware of these structures.",Software doesn't need to know about database structures.
"Databases Access
With the exception of record and device support, all access to the 
database is via the channel or database access routines.",All database access is through channels or routines.
"Databases Scanning
Database scanning is the mechanism for deciding when to process 
a record.",Decide when to process a record.
"Four types of scanning are possible: Periodic, Event, I/O Event, and Passive.","Four kinds of scan are possible: periodic, event, input/output event, passive."
Periodic:    A request can be made to process a record periodically.,A record can be processed at regular times.
"The actual subroutine call is: 
post_event(event_num) I/O Event:    The I/O event scanning system processes
 records based on external interrupts.",The program calls post_event and looks at records because of an interrupt.
"An IOC device driver interrupt routine must 
be available to accept the external interrupts.",The driver must be ready for interrupts.
"Record Support, Device Support, and Device Drivers

each record type has an associated record support module.",Each record type has a special help module.
"If the method of accessing hardware is complicated,
 a device driver can be provided to shield the device support modules.","If it's hard to access hardware, a driver helps."

about the record support layer other than how to call it.",The software doesn't know about the layers except for calling them.
"The record support layer in 
turn knows nothing about it’s device support layer other than how to call it.",It doesn't know anything about its own support layer except how to call it.

 the only thing a device support layer knows about it’s associated driver is how to call it.",Device layer just knows how to call its driver.
"This design allows a particular installation and even a particular IOC within an installation
 to choose the set of record types, device types, and drivers it wishes to use.","This design lets you pick what records, devices, and drivers you want to use."
"It is this routine that is called by the database
 scanners.",The database scanners call this routine.
"Databases Monitors
The routines described in this section provide a callback mechanism
 for database value changes.","Database values change, notify."
"This allows the caller to be notiﬁed when database
 values change without constantly polling the database.",The caller gets told when database values change.
"A mask can be set to specify
 value changes, alarm state changes, and/or archive changes.","A mask sets value, alarm, or archive changes."
"Because they are of interest only to channel access, the monitor routines
 will not be described.",These routines won't be explained because they're only for special channels.
"Each IOC provides a channel access server which 
is willing to establish communication with an arbitrary number of clients.",IOC gives a server that talks to many clients.
"It should be noted that channel access
 does not provide access to database records as records.",Channel access doesn't give you database records.

any software that accesses the database via channel access.",New records can be added without affecting software that uses the database.
"A channel access
 client can communicate with multiple IOCs having differing 
sets of record types.",Client talks to many devices with different kinds of data.
they are used to monitor and control IOCs.,They watch IOCs.

developer would be crazy to ignore tools such as MEDM (or EDD/DM).",Any developer is crazy to ignore these tools.
"Most OPI tools do not, however, have to be used.",Most OPI tools don't need to be used.
"Each of the Gemini Controls work packages will be involved with some 
aspect of EPICS development ranging from creation of new device drivers to database 
creation and the design of new CA clients.The details of the EPICS work required can be 
broken down into several broad categories which reﬂect the nature of the various work 
packages.","Gemini Controls will do some EPICS work, like making drivers or designing clients."
"Other OPI CA Clients

AR request ﬁles, ALH alarm conﬁguration ﬁles, 
and the like.",Files for OPI Channel Access Tools include MEDM files and others.
"For the purposes of work performed for the Gemini 8-m Telescopes 
Project the following deﬁnitions will be used to differentiate 
between the two ﬂavors of EPICS development work:","For Gemini 8-m Telescopes Project, we use these definitions."
"The latter two items would be covered 
under Advanced Application Development and a case can probably be made 
that they constitute a category unto themselves which should be labeled 
something like ‘Internals - Tools’",These last two things are tools.
"These are all topics that would be covered in an EPICS Basics, Building 
and Using Applications course.",EPICS Basics course covers these topics.
The following sections list those that would be commonly used.,Those sections are common.
"The experience of the High Energy Physics community is that only a 
core group of Internals developers is required for maintenance and enhancement of 
EPICS IOC software and of the standard development and CA client tool set.",A core group of developers is enough to maintain EPICS IOC software.
"Many sites contribute custom CA client tools as this generally involves C or 
C++ programming under a UNIX O/S to interface to the standard CA library.",Some websites make special computer programs for working with certificates.
"Although there is presently a large amount of activity in the enhancement of 
EPICS Internals software especially in the ﬁelds of non-IOC core software, this is 
an order of magnitude less than the amount of Applications work under way at over 
20 distinct programs.","There's a lot of activity improving EPICS Internals software, but it's much less than the work on applications at many programs."
"Another large group of predominately Applications developers that are 
starting work are the Collaborative Access Teams (CATS) at 
Argonne’s Advanced Photon Source (APS).The APS is a facility to produce high brilliance 
X-rays for a variety of experiments and includes 36 experimental halls with 2 lines each.","Many developers start work at Argonne's Advanced Photon Source, which makes strong X-rays for many experiments."
"Because the experimental areas must be coordinated with the main facility control 
system and since 25% of the beamtime must be made available to independent investigators 
it was strongly recommended that EPICS be used as the toolkit for all CATS development 
work.",Use EPICS for all CATS work because it helps with coordination and gives space to others.
"Typically, each CAT has 1 or 2 developers, and the major focus is not on the IOC software 
although some new records, like the Multichannel Analyser, have been created, but rather 
on the OPI CA client applications.","Each CAT has 1-2 developers, focusing on OPI CA client apps."
"Heavy use is being made of both Tcl/TK and IDL to 
support high-level sequencing and data reduction.",Tcl/Tk and IDL are used a lot for simplifying complex sequences and reducing data.
"This is similar to the Gemini architecture 
as the bulk of the control system intelligence is contained within OPI CA client tasks.",This is like Gemini's architecture.
"Different science programs in use at each CAT which have complex associated data 
acquisition and reduction routines.",Different science programs are used at each CAT with complicated data processing.
"It is 
anticipated that all other IOC-related work packages will be performing exclusively

SIC development staff will be made available.",RGO SIC development staff will be available for future work.
"This mechanism requires that some (unknown to the source) target subsystem

"It is possible that the channel is 
'intelligent', in the sense that data may be converted from one form to another 
during transmission.",The channel might change data forms during transmission.
"The A&G might be transmitting Zernickes to the PMCS, which is receiving Shack-
Hartmann data.","A and G are sending Zernickes to PMCS, which gets Shack-Hartmann data."
"It is possible that a channel have multiple sources, multiple targets, or both!","A channel can have many sources, many targets, or both."
"Finally, 
a channel might use a separate physical route, to prevent large data transmissions (say) 
from interfering with the 'normal' command streams.",A channel may take a different path to avoid big data from slowing down normal commands.
"For example, the OCS might broadcast a RunTest 
command, causing all subsystems to perform self-testing.",OCS sends command for systems to test themselves.
"As another example, a 
critical system failure might cause a ShutDown command 
to be broadcast.","System fails, sends shut down message."

"However call waiting does not operate during
the prior set up of the call between the parties A and B (including alerting if used).",Call waiting doesn't work while setting up a call between A and B.
"Therefore the alerting duration has to be as short as possible in order to minimize the
risk for the party A of missing notification of an incoming call from party C with a

"This document describes the requirements specification (SRS) for the software infrastructure (or
      product) that enables the internetworking of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) through peering,
      henceforth termed as ‘CDN peering’, and provides an overall description of it.",This document describes requirements for CDNs to connect with each other.
"It presents a means for
      distinct CDNs to coordinate and cooperate with other CDNs, by investigating and developing (a)
      models for effective internetworking between CDNs though peering; (b) protocols for service
      delivery in a cooperative environment of CDNs; (c) some concrete examples (technology trends) that
      exhibits the notion of content networking; and (d) policies for autonomic management of service level
      through resource negotiation in an on-demand basis.","CDNs work together by sharing ideas, rules, and examples to deliver services better."
"When writing this SRS for CDN peering, the following terminologies are used:",We use these terms when writing about CDN peering.
"Web server (WS): The container of content comprising of two layersoverlay, which is a collection of Web service host (e.g.",Web server has two parts: overlay and hosts.
"Apache, Tomcat), Service Level Agreement (SLA)- allocator, and policy agent, and core, which refers to the underlying hardware infrastructure.","Apache, Tomcat, SLA allocator, and policy agent are on top of the computer hardware."
PM: A set of mediator-specific rules for interaction and negotiation.,Rules for talking and agreeing.
"This document is written for the researchers, software developers, advanced practitioners,
      documentation writers, and users involved in CDN domain to initiation an open discussion for
      exploring development opportunities regarding the internetworking between CDNs.",This document is for people who work with CDNs to discuss how they can be used together.
"Section 2
      discusses the steps that are to be undertaken to “bring-up” or “cease” an internetworking arrangement
      between CDNs.",Section 2 talks about how to start or stop a connection between CDNs.
"In the next section, system features with their functional requirements are presented
      to highlight the major services provided by the intended product.",The system's main services are shown here.
"Finally, this specification is concluded with the reference documents on
      which this document is based on.",This document ends with references it's based on.
"The final product enabling CDN peering assists in coordinated and cooperative content delivery via
      internetworking among distinct CDNs to allow providers to rapidly “scale-out” to meet both flash
      crowds and anticipated increases in demand, and remove the need for a single CDN to provision
      resources.",CDN peering helps different CDNs work together to deliver content quickly.
"An ad-hoc or planned peering of CDNs requires fundamental research to be undertaken to
      address the core problems of measuring and disseminating load information, performing request
      assignment and redirection, enabling content replication and determining appropriate compensation
      among participants on a geographically distributed “Internet” scale.","CDNs need research to solve problems with sharing data, directing requests, copying content, and paying others."
"In contrast to a single CDN, for
      which these issues are deeply interrelated and co-dependent, the main thrust for the final product
      enabling CDN peering is to consider them in a coordinated and cooperative manner among many
      peered CDNs, whilst satisfying the complex multi-dimensional constraints placed on each individual
      provider.",Many CDNs work together to solve problems while following rules.
"Each provider must ensure that their individual SLAs are met when serving content for its
      own customers to end users, while meeting any obligations it has made when participating in a group
      of many providers.",Each provider must meet its own rules and follow group rules when serving content to customers.
The performance models to demonstrate the effects of peering and to predict user perceived performance [4].,The models show how peering affects performance and predict what users will see.
"CDN peering allows different CDN providers to share resources in order to provide larger scale
      and/or reach to each participant than they could not achieve otherwise.",CDN peering lets CDNs work together for bigger results.
"It is formed by a set of
      autonomous CDNs, which cooperate through a mechanism that provides facilities and infrastructure
      for cooperation in order to virtualize multiple providers.",CDNs work together to share things.
"It is expected that an effective peering
      arrangement between CDNs would require multiple steps to occur.",CDNs need many steps.
Peering allows a particular CDN to achieve larger scale/reach through resource sharing with other CDN(s).,Peering lets CDNs share resources and reach more people.
"flash crowds, when the (primary) CDN realizes that it cannot handle a part of the workload on its Web Servers (WSs).",CDN gets too busy and needs help from web servers.
Negotiated relationship: The controlling interest of a CDN to interconnect with other CDNs leads to the creation of a negotiated relationship.,CDNs work together.
"In the business domain, this relationship (most likely) would take the form of a legal document which describes the expected level of services from the involving parties such as storage requirements, the required rate of transfer, cost of services; the expected duration of receiving service, penalties for service violations, and other preconditions such as the initiating CDN’s preference to gain resources at a particular region.",The business deal would be written in a contract that says what each side agrees on.
"Therefore, divergent policies are allowed that specify the information that can be shared during interaction through providing a certain level of visibility to preserve privacy.",Different rules allow sharing some info while keeping private things hidden.
"Resource discovery: Once the initiating CDN identifies its roles and activities through the created negotiated relationships for coordination and cooperation between CDNs, the next step is to choose potential CDNs to peer with.",CDN picks other CDNs to work with.
The mediator instance passes the service requirements to the local PA to discover external resources from peers.,The mediator gives the service needs to the local helper to find things from friends.
"The PA performs the resource discovery process through predicting performance of the peers, working around issues of separate administration and limited information sharing among enlisted CDNs.",The PA finds resources by looking at how well other networks work together.
If there are any preexisting peering arrangements (for a long term scenario) then these will be returned at this point.,"If already set up, we show them."
CDN peering protocols: The next step is to configure the ‘CDN peering’ protocols at the conduit of the respective CDNs in order to technically support the terms and policies implicitly specified through the negotiated relationships.,Configure CDN peering protocols at each CDN's connection point.
"This step includes advertising the configurations (topology aspects, geographical proximity, capability, performance, etc.)",Advertise settings.
"On establishment of a peering arrangement, these protocols also allow participating CDNs to exchange information regarding the content availability and assists to redirect requests to an optimal peer.",CDNs share info about content and help route requests to best peers.
Request-redirection in a peering arrangement depends on the content distribution and request-routing policies (specified in the CDN peering protocols) associated with the content as well as the specific algorithms and methods used for directing these requests.,Content is sent to users based on rules.
"Operational management: When the primary CDN acquires sufficient resources from the peers to meet its SLA with the customer, the new peering arrangement becomes operational.","When the main CDN gets enough help from others, it works properly."
"Once a peering arrangement is established, all participating parties cooperate in the execution of common goal(s).",Parties work together after an agreement is made.
Peering also enables the CDNs to exchange accounting information to perform billing based on the negotiated relationships.,CDNs share financial info for billing.
Disband or re-arrangement: An existing peering arrangement may need to either disband or re-arrange itself (within the scope of the negotiated relationships) if any of the following conditions hold: (a) the circumstances under which the arrangement was formed no longer hold; (b) peering is no longer beneficial for the participating CDNs; (c) an existing peering arrangement needs to be expanded further in order to deal with additional load; or (d) participating CDNs are not meeting their agreed upon contributions.,"If conditions change, a peering arrangement may need to end or change."
Development and validation of peering and manage the complexity of content delivery across Web servers of multiple CDNs that scale across the globe.,Make simple content work on many web servers worldwide.
Assists an existing CDN to alleviate congestions by detecting and handling short-term load spikes (i.e.,Help a busy network by finding and fixing sudden traffic jams.
The policy agent is responsible (in conjunction with the mediator) for determining which resources can be delegated and under what conditions (policies) delegation is permitted.,The agent decides who gets what and when.
"to satisfy both local and delegated SLAs, and ensures that the terms of the SLAs are enforced.",Meet deadlines.
It works in conjunction with its local PA to discover external resources and to negotiate with other CDNs.,It finds things outside and talks to others.
"Once a peering arrangement is established, it controls what portion of the Web traffic (i.e.","Once set up, it decides what web traffic to control."
"end-user requests) is redirected to the Web servers of the peering CDNs, which content is replicated there, how the replication decision is taken, and which replication policies are being used.",CDNs send user requests to their own servers where content is stored.
It ensures that the participating entities are able to adapt to changing circumstances (agility) and are able to achieve their objectives in a dynamic and uncertain environment (resilience),It helps things adjust to changes and reach goals in a changing world.
"It helps in discovering local resources through enabling the Web servers of CDN providers to register and publish their resource, service and policy details.",It helps find local things by letting web servers share what they have.
"When a new peering arrangement is established, an instance of the service registry is created that encapsulates all local and delegated external CDN resources.",A new service registry is made when a new peering arrangement starts.
Content replication is performed using a cooperative pull-based approach where participating CDNs assist each others in serving data.,CDNs help each other share data.
"Thus, content replication is featured through extending it to participating servers from the peers in a given peering arrangement, subject to the available resources they contribute",Content is copied to other servers that are connected to each other and have enough resources.
"Load distribution is performed by measuring the load information and disseminating it within individual CDNs and amongst other CDNs using a hierarchical approach, where current bandwidth and resource usage of web servers in a CDN is reported to the CDN gateway (i.e.",Load distribution happens by sharing load info with CDNs.
"Therefore, endusers can be assigned via DNS (by the peering agents of participating CDNs updating their DNS records regularly) and also via redirection at the CDN gateway when appropriate.",End users can be assigned by DNS or CDN gateway.
"Explicit members include the primary CDN, which is the initiator of a peering
      relationship, and any peering CDNs who cooperate for resource sharing.",Primary CDN starts a connection with other CDNs to share resources.
"For instance, a short-term peering arrangement is to be automated to react within a tight time
      frameas it is unlikely that a human directed negotiation would occur quickly enough to satisfy the
      evolved niche.",Automate quick reaction for short-term deals.
"On the other hand, establishment of a long-term peering arrangement calls for a
      human-directed agent to ensure that any resulting decisions comply with participating CDNs’
      strategic goals.",A human is needed to make sure decisions match the plans of all involved groups.
"Users can also be classified because of the preferential treatment that they may receive
      due to the policy that pertains to a particular provider’s business logic.",Users get special treatment based on a company's rules.
"Moreover, individual users (or
      a group of users) can have dynamic QoS requirements depending on the situations that will result in
      “customized” content delivery.","Individuals may need different levels of quality for their internet use, depending on what they are doing."
"Thus, users (or class of users) can be differentiated based on userdefined
      QoS specifications while accessing the service.",Users can be different based on what they want from a service.
"prototype system) enabling CDN peering is expected to be deployed it in a realworld
      test bed such as PlanetLab for global testing, observations, and for performance evaluation.",Prototype system will be tested on PlanetLab.
"In
      this regard, existing Web services technologies will be studied in detail to examine the feasibility of
      leveraging them.",Existing Web services will be studied.
"A modular
      implementation approach would be useful to perform testing on modules at different stages to ensure
      correct implementation.",Test modules early to make sure they work correctly.
"It is anticipated that a cryptographically secure auction-based framework will
      be used to assist content replication among peered CDNs to allow incentives for all participants.",Secure auction helps copy files between networks.
"Request
      assignment and redirection could predominantly rely on DNS-level end-user assignment combined
      with a rudimentary request assignment policy such as weighted round-robin or least-loaded-first,
      which updates the DNS records to point to the most appropriate replica server of the peers.",Assign users to servers based on DNS and use a simple rule to choose the best one.
"Due
      to the proprietary nature of existing CDNs, limited information about response time or service cost is
      typically available from individual CDNs, and load balancing control is retained by an individual
      provider within its own Web servers.",CDNs don't share info on speed or price because it's private. They also keep control of how traffic is spread.
"It is anticipated that the
      values used in a CDN peering implementation model are likely to be based on heuristics.",Values will be based on guesses.
"Along with the software product, a user manual would be written to help people understand the
      working methodology and usage of the developed prototype system.",The user manual will explain how to use the new system.
"It would be written for nontechnical
      individuals and the level of content or terminology would differ considerably from, for
      example, a System Administration Guide, which is more detailed and complex.",It's for people who don't know much about tech and uses simpler words than a guide for experts.
"The user manual
      would follow common user documentation styles capturing purpose and scope of the product along
      with key system features and operations; step-by-step instructions for using the system including
      conventions, messaging structures, quick references, tips for errors and malfunctions; pointers to
      reference documents; and glossary of terms.",The user manual explains how to use the product with steps and helps if something goes wrong.
"In
      particular, the design and implementation approach of MotusNet could be helpful to draw a clear
      guideline for developing the intended prototype.",The design of MotusNet can help create a guide for building the prototype.
"Being a major important section of
      the SRS, this section is expected to go through iterative improvement to make the most logical sense
      for the intended product.",This part of the SRS will be improved many times until it makes sense.
"Service registration is triggered when either one of the following occurs: (a) resources
          are available as a provider starts operating; (b) previously registered resource
          information needs to be updated; (c) available local resource information is required in
          the event of traffic surges; and (d) local and delegated external resource information is
          to be encapsulated in an SR instance included in an established peering arrangement.","Service registration happens when resources are available, need updating, or needed for a surge."
"These resources
          could be provisioned and reserved to satisfy SLAs.",Use these resources to meet agreements.
"If it is a new resource, its service information is registered in the SR with a new resource ID.",New resource gets a new ID and info goes to SR.
"If a resource fails, its service information is removed from SR and the resource ID counter is decremented.","Resource fails, remove info, count down."
Mediator: Receives initiation request from WS to trigger peering.,Mediator gets a start signal from WS to connect.
"It is invoked when a (primary) CDN realizes that it cannot handle a part of the
          workload on its WS(s).",CDN can't handle some work so it asks for help.
"Exceptional circumstances such as flash crowds have occurred to place unanticipated
          load on CDN WSs.",Big crowds happened and made a lot of work for our servers.
An initialization request is sent to the mediator to trigger peering.,Send a message to start talking.
"If the user requests experience service timeout (threshold), initiation request is
          cancelled.","User asks for a time limit, then starts nothing."
"On receipt of the initialization request to trigger peering, the mediator of the primary CDN invokes
        negotiation.",The mediator starts negotiating when it gets a special message.
"PR: Sends policy information for establishing negotiated relationships
          PA: Receives service requirements from the mediator.",Send policy info and get service needs.
The mediator instance obtains resource and access information from the SR and policy information from PR to establish negotiation.,Mediator gets info from SR and PR to start talking.
"If the service requirements are acceptable according to the provider’s policy, mediator passes it to the local PA.","If okay, send to local PA."
"If the user requests can not be accepted according the provider policies, service
          requirements are not passed to the local PA.","If provider rules reject user requests, service is not sent to local PA."
Mediator works in conjunction with the PA to establish negotiation.,Mediator and PA work together to negotiate.
"If any peering policies exist, they are returned to establish long-term peering arrangement.","If there are rules for connecting, we get them to connect for a long time."
"If sufficient resources are acquired, a peering arrangement is established","Get resources, make deal."
"Else, mediator re-evaluates service requirements and sends to the local PA to perform re-negotiation.",Mediator checks needs again and tells local helper to talk about it again.
"If the user requests can not be accepted according the provider policies, service
          requirements are not passed to the local PA.","If provider rules reject user requests, service details won't go to local PA."
There is procedure to perform short-term negotiation.,Do a short-term negotiation.
"Once policies are negotiated and a peering arrangement is established, PAs interact
            each other in the execution of common goal(s).",PAs work together after agreements are made.
"Once a peering arrangement is established, the initiating primary CDN through its local PA advertise configuration information to technically support the negotiated relationships between enlisted CDNs.",CDN tells other CDNs what they need to know.
PAs exchange content availability and load information to identify an optimal peer to handle user requests.,PAs share info to find best helper for users.
PAs exchange accounting information to perform billing based on negotiated relationships.,PAs share numbers to get paid according to their agreements.
"If a peered CDN provider refuses to accept user requests, a given peering arrangement
            ceases.","If a CDN provider says no, the agreement ends."
"There could be circumstances under which a given peering arrangement may need to disband or rearranges
        itself.",The arrangement might need to change.
A given peering arrangement is currently in operation and peers are cooperating for effective content delivery.,Peers work together to deliver content.
"for which any peer is unable to honor the negotiated relationships, a given peering arrangement is not disband or re-arranged and SLA conditions are bypassed.","If a peer can't keep its promises, the agreement stays the same."
Policies are in place to perform renegotiation for problem resolution.,Policies help fix problems by talking again.
Policies are in place to perform renegotiation for problem resolution.,Policies help fix problems by talking again.
"For user interface design, common GUI standards will be followed along with
    the presence of keyboard shortcuts, error message display standards etc., and standard buttons and
    functions (i.e.","We follow standard designs for user interfaces, including keyboard shortcuts and error messages."
"Details of the user interface design are intended to be
    documented in a separate user interface specification.",User interface details will be written down separately.
"As mentioned earlier, the intended product to exploit existing Web service technologies to leverage
      existing infrastructures through building an overlay.",Use existing web services and infrastructure to build something on top.
"From a technical point of view,
      TCP/IP will be used as the transport protocol, where each CDN server establishes a TCP connection
      to the network elements using a well-known port number.",TCP/IP is used for transport and CDNs use a special port number.
"Interaction among
      surrogates will be performed using HTTP or FTP.",Surrogates use HTTP or FTP.
"The review reflected that WP2 presents with its deliverable D2.1 “an ambitious, high quality vision,
    reflected in a 4 stage maturity model, which is well argued.” The general feedback received for this
    document was positive, especially highlighting various insightful remarks.",The review says WP2 has a good plan with a 4-stage growth model that makes sense. People liked it and thought some parts were very smart.

        sustainability.","Organisational details will explain how users interact, pilot plans, testing rules, business ideas, and maintenance systems for long-term success."
"However, the
    current European public eProcurement infrastructure is inappropriate because it is characterized by a
    high market fragmentation and a lack of interoperability.",The current system is bad because it's broken into many pieces and doesn't work together well.
"Hence, a major objective of the European
    Commission is to enable European-wide eProcurement across borders by creating common principles
    and technical solutions that are applied within all Member States.","The European Commission wants to make it easy for companies in Europe to buy things from each other online, no matter where they are."
"eProcurement requires efforts to be
    done by public administrations, in particular to exploit new technologies for interoperability that enable
    easy information accessibility, improving the availability of pan-European services and interaction
    among citizens and businesses (European_Dynamics_S_A 2004).",Public administrations need to use new technology to make it easier for people and businesses to access information.
"Governments are the largest buyer in the European Union which purchase at a level of approximately
    15-20% of GDP (Ministerial_Declaration 2005).",Governments buy 15-20% of Europe's economy.
"Common standards for electronic data
    exchange seem to be a key element for companies to participate in public eProcurement.",Companies need common rules for sharing digital information to join government buying online.
"The Manchester ministerial declaration of 24 November 2005 defines the target that
    ((Ministerial_Declaration 2005) p.4): “By 2010 all public administrations across Europe will have the
    capability of carrying out 100% of their procurement electronically, where legally permissible, thus
    creating a fairer and more transparent market for all companies independent of a company’s size or
    location within the single market.",All European public administrations will be able to buy things online by 2010.
"Over the period 2006-2010 Member States
    will focus their efforts on delivering those high impact services in Europe which will contribute most to
    the achievement of the Lisbon Agenda.”
    It is expected that an interoperable eProcurement infrastructure ensures equal treatment and nondiscrimination
    and that it facilitates fairer and more effective competition in the European market by
    enabling suppliers to compete in an open and transparent way.",Member States will focus on delivering key services from 2006-2010.
"However, current eProcurement
    infrastructures are inappropriate to reach this ambitious aim since these are characterized by a high
    market fragmentation.",Current systems are not good enough because they are broken into many small parts.
"Systems are either centrally oriented
    or designed to reflect federated systems demands.",Systems are central or federal.
"The lack of a unified eProcurement terminology is a major barrier which
    affects the possibility of a smooth collaboration between Member States and their eProcurement
    systems (Commission_of_the_European_Communitites 2004).",Lack of common language makes it hard for countries to work together.
"Legal, technical and organisational
    barriers prevent the development of a common Procurement infrastructure and are one of the greatest
    challenges to be solved by politics, governments, ICT industry and research
    (European_Dynamics_S_A 2004).",Barriers stop a shared buying system from being developed.
"PEPPOL2 aims at setting up pan-European pilot solutions that
    conjointly exist with national infrastructures.",PEPPOL2 sets up European solutions that work with national ones.
"Among the building blocks the PEPPOL consortium develops, the Virtual Company Dossier (VCD)
    focuses on an interoperable solution which contains the documents required from economic operators
    to evidence their qualification as well as qualitative selection or exclusion according to the directive
    2004/18/EC.",PEPPOL develops a Virtual Company Dossier that includes necessary documents for companies to prove their qualifications and be selected or excluded according to EU rules.
"A VCD will facilitate electronic Tendering by providing cross-border data and document solution that
      contains the necessary attestations and certificates typically required in eTendering.",A VCD helps with online bidding by sharing important documents across borders.
"When a
      contracting authority publishes a contract notice, it shall include the selection, qualification and nonexclusion
      criteria.","When publishing a contract notice, include what you look for in a bidder."
"The economic operators have to submit evidence and proof in respect of these
      criteria.",They must show proof.
"Hence, during the preparation of the tender an economic operator needs to collect the
      respective evidences (i.e.",Operator gets evidence.
"The overall aims and expectations of a virtual company dossier solution as set out in the description of
      work can be described as follows:",The goals are listed here.
"The VCD will support any authorised entities (economic operator, intermediary, contracting
          authority or IT service such as an eTendering system) in creating an electronic information
          package consisting of the required documentation, evidences, proof, attestations, certificates,
          declarations and metadata.",The VCD helps authorized groups make a digital package with needed documents.
"In order to create the VCD, an implemented IT system will have to collect certificates and
          attestations from existing registries.",The system must get certificates from existing lists.
"It also enables the economic operator to add self-declarations
          or other documents of formal qualification.",It lets you add papers that prove your qualifications.
"Furthermore, the VCD solution supports economic operators in producing a VCD and in enabling
          them to submit the required documentation (assembled as an information package) to any
          contracting authority in Europe.",The VCD solution helps companies make a VCD and send needed papers to European authorities.
"In the same way the VCD as an implemented IT system will enable contracting authorities or their
          eTendering systems to interpret and accept the documentation submitted by the economic
          operator.",The VCD system will help contracting authorities understand and accept documents from bidders.
"Therefore the contracting authority must either specify the documentation that has to be submitted
          by economic operator or the criteria of qualitative selection and exclusion that have to be fulfilled
          by the economic operator.",The contractor must say what documents are needed or what they need to do to qualify.
"For all parties (economic operator, intermediary, contracting authority, issuing bodies) it will be of
          high importance that the VCD Service Providers are trustworthy; this implies that the services are
          precise, up-to-date, available and reliable.","All parties need to trust VCD Service Providers, which means they must provide accurate, updated, available, and reliable services."
"The status quo concerning the tendering process, observed in the European countries of this work
      package, is depicted in a generic status-quo procedure as shown in Figure 1.",The way things are done now is shown in Figure 1.
"The procedure can be described as follows: A Contracting Authority prepares a call for tender
      based on a set of documents, usually consisting of a) the publication of a contract notice b) the tender
      contract documentation c) the (technical) specifications, d) additional documents.",A contracting authority makes a call for tenders using some papers.
"The contract notice
      is produced and transmitted to the official gazette such as the Tenders Electronic Daily (TED) when
      due.",The contract notice goes to the official gazette like TED on time.
"It should be noted that for public tenders above a certain threshold, the publication in the Official
      Journal of the European Union (TED) is mandatory.","For big public tenders, it's required to publish them in the EU's official journal."
"An Economic Operator can use means such as the TED system, existing tendering platforms or
      official national gazettes to search for contract notices (2) and to retrieve the relevant information
      about active tenders (3).",An operator can find contracts on websites or in newspapers.
"The mandatory publication of contract notices in TED is a means to ensure transparency for
      public procurement throughout Europe and to enable a well functioning inner market.",Publishing contracts helps make public spending clear and fair across Europe.
"If an Economic Operator decides to participate in a public tender across border, the appropriate
      selection and exclusion criteria have to be evaluated.",An operator must check rules before joining a cross-border bid.
"This means that the Economic Operator has to
      match these criteria set out in the contract notice of another country with the evidences (attestations,
      statements and certificates) of his or her own country in order to prove compliance (4).",The operator must match the contract's criteria with their own country's documents.
in the country where the Economic Operator is established (5).,In the country where it is based.
"The step of retrieving proofs of suitability and non-exclusion and collecting documents for the receiving
      entities becomes a necessary task and may take place at different times.",Get proof and papers ready for others.
"In some European Member
      State countries the “self-declaration” (a statement issued by the Economic Operator) is adopted to
      claim an initial suitability for applying and attending a tender.",Some EU countries use self-declaration to show they are suitable for tenders.
"In this case, Economic Operators may
      retrieve their proofs of suitability only at a later stage if necessary at all.",They can get them later if needed.
"In this
      case, accredited official translators, lawyers or notaries have to issue such legally attested translations
      of evidences.",Accredited officials must translate evidence documents.
The following flows of documents have to be considered specifically:,These documents must be looked at carefully.
documents that cannot be generated in the target language by the originating authority;,Documents not made by the original group.
documents that must be accessed by the contracting authority from the official source.,Get documents from the right place.
"In the long-run the VCD should be able to adequately fulfil the contracting
        authorities’ need to prove suitability and non-exclusion of economic operators according to certain
        criteria while reducing the burden of proof for the economic operator.","The VCD should show that it is suitable and not exclusive, and make it easier for companies to prove this."
"This requires a paradigm shift
        towards electronic exchange of evidence and a next generation of attestations and certificates that are
        currently just barely available in electronic form.",Change to electronic way.
"The creation of uniform infrastructure in this
        heterogeneous domain will take some time as several different environments and stakeholders need
        to be involved, and change may not be enforceable to all of them.",It takes time to create a common system because many different groups are involved.
"In order to reach these goals we propose an approach with different stages of maturity that may be
        applied dependent on the readiness for the individual Member State.",We suggest a plan with steps of growing up that can be used depending on how ready each country is.
"The aim is to support basic
        interoperability and exchange of documents on the lower maturity levels and leading towards direct
        electronic exchange of evidence in the higher maturity levels.","Support simple document sharing at first, then move to direct electronic sharing later."
In the following we will introduce the staged maturity model for the VCD as depicted in Figure 2.,We will show a model for growing up in this section.
"Every Member State should develop a solution that meets
        the demands of basic interoperability.",Each country must make something that works together.
"Basic interoperability can thereby be defined as a state where
        organisational transparency of cross-border tendering requirements is established (stage 1- pre-VCD
        mapping tool).",Basic interoperability means knowing what's needed for international tenders.
"The efforts and expenses to develop a solution that ensures basic interoperability ought
        to be manageable and affordable.Member States, who would like to advance their solution towards a higher level of interoperability, can
        do so by adopting subsequent VCD maturity levels.",Developing a solution for easy sharing should not cost too much. Countries that want to make it better can do this by following later steps.
"An
        eTendering system and a contracting authority must be able to interpret a VCD package assembled by
        a VCD application regardless of the implementation stage of the VCD application and the eTendering
        system.","An eTendering system and a contracting authority can understand a VCD package made by a VCD application, no matter when it was created."
"Figure 2 illustrates the staged maturity model of the VCD that has been designed to show the
        different stages of implementation and development.",Figure 2 shows how something grows in steps.
"It is
        therefore necessary to ensure national transparency by gathering national requirements on certificates
        and qualification documents.",We need to know what's needed for national qualifications.
"The first implementation level (stage 1) is dependent upon these national
        requirements and will define a basic semantic interoperability model that supports the mutual
        recognition of certificates and qualification documents (pre-VCD mapping tool).",First stage depends on national rules. It defines how to share information about qualifications and certificates.
"The next step then is to define the structure of a VCD by adding several types of (meta)data into it
        (e.g.",Next step is to add data into VCD.
"and to build an application that is
        able to compile VCDs and enabling economic operators to submit this information electronically to
        contracting authorities (Stage 2).",Build app to compile VCDs and send info to contracting authorities.
"Stage 3 includes one of the most critical parts of a VCD which consist of making the evidences
        contained in a VCD comparable with regard to their contents to enable automated processing and
        understanding of its contents across borders (stage 3 – VCD advanced package).",Stage 3 compares evidence on a VCD so it can be processed and understood easily.
"Stage 4 (VCD networked package) will then provide a sophisticated method for changing the overall
        process from push to pull.",Stage 4 changes it from pushing to pulling.
"Instead a contracting authority can
        request those documents on demand from a database (pull) at national service provider who hosts
        VCD services, or directly from the very registration authority.",Get documents from a database or directly from the registration authority.
"The model as presented in Figure 2 is further described in the following
        subsection with the purpose to detail the various stages.",The model is explained in more detail below.
"For a future maturity path of a VCD Service one has to take into consideration the most important
        points of the vision and the goals of a VCD, which are:",Think about what VCD wants.
Compiling a VCD Package is a service supporting Economic Operators and/or Contracting Authorities in procurement procedures,Compile package for buyers.
"The real benefit could be gained when the VCD Package (which may be seen as a container for
            documents – structured or unstructured – and additional information) is complete and accurate.",The benefit comes from having a complete and accurate package.
"The following preconditions and assumptions that define the context of VCD Services and VCD
        Packages should be taken into consideration:",Consider these conditions.
"Criteria for qualification and selection are in accordance with the Directives 2004/18/EC4,5(public
            procurement) and 2004/17/EC6 (utilities), and are used to map among national requirements.",Criteria follow EU rules and match national needs.
"Documents may be machine readable (digital copies, unstructured contents) or machine
            interpretable (structured content, thus can be processed by machines)",Documents are either digital and easy to read or structured and can be used by computers.
"An attestation is made up of one (or more) document(s) including machine interpretable data that
            describes these attestation (e.g.",One or more documents with machine-readable information describe an attestation.
VCD can provide direct access to attestation if there is a mandatory rule for it in law.,VCD gives direct access if law says so.
"VCD systems provide single point of contact to attestations from public sources and information
            necessary to prove conformance to a given call for tender.",VCD gives one place to get proof that it meets the requirements.
A VCD Package may be linked to exactly one call for tender thus it is tender specific,A VCD package links to one call for tender.
"In accordance to the above mentioned major visions and requirements two important dimensions are
        to be considered in order to assess the benefits of a VCD Service and a VCD Package (cf.",Two key things must be looked at to see the good points of a VCD Service and a VCD Package.
"The different levels of support address both the maturity of the service and the maturity of the VCD
          package, where the latter corresponds to the semantic richness of the provided information.",Different levels help with service and package maturity.
"On the
          Peppol/WP2 strategy there is explicit interest to have parallel increments on both sides, assuming that
          the semantic enrichment of the VCD package requires a corresponding enriched supporting system.",The Peppol/WP2 strategy wants equal growth on both sides because it needs a better system to support its package.
"Which attestations, certificates or statements provide evidence for which criteria (making up the
              mapping), including the possibility of using self-declarations;",What shows proof for what rules?
issuing authority) the evidences are provided.,Authority provides evidence.
"On this level of support the VCD rule set is defined as a reference model which is manually or semiautomatically
              consulted by the economic operator and/or the contracting authority.",The VCD rule set is used as a guide by operators and authorities.
"Compilation Support: Helps the responsible player (in most cases the economic operator) to compile
              a VCD Package according to the defined definitions/regulations/rule set/model by means of a
              specialized VCD Service (not necessarily implying an IT-System):",Helps the person in charge make a package.
"The individual evidences are enriched with additional descriptions/metadata (adding structural
              data of evidence);",Evidence gets more details added to it.
"The VCD Package as a whole contains additional metadata, describing the VCD package itself
              (VCD package data, e.g.",The package has extra details about itself.
"Evidences are provided in a structured and machine interpretable form, at least those that can be
              easily transformed in such representation;",Some evidence is easy to change into a format computers can understand.
"The contracting authority may control whether or not the evidences prove the required criteria (as
              opposed to the level of compilation support, where one only could check if the VCD is complete
              and the attestations are valid).",The authority can decide if evidence meets the needed standards.
"A VCD Package will show its full potential when all the requested evidences (all that are necessary to
          prove all requested criteria) are contained in it.",The package works best with all needed proof.
"From
          a pragmatic point of view, it seems reasonable to focus on a subset of evidences in a first step and to
          complete the VCD Package later on.","Focus on some evidence first, then finish the package later."
"It is also reasonable to define a default package list that has to
          be provided in most public tenders by economic operators independently of particular criteria
          mentioned by the “Call for Tender”.",It's reasonable to have a standard list of packages needed in many public bids.
"Develop possibilities to map and add other documents (self declarations or statements from banks
              etc.)",Add more papers to a map.
"The criteria for qualitative selection and non-exclusion as defined in the Directive 2004/18/EC are the
        common ground for building a cross border VCD service.",The rules for choosing and not excluding things match across countries to build a shared TV service.
"The figure below shows the relevant criteria
        as defined in Articles 45-50 as these are regarded the most common ground when mapping any
        national criteria to the European ones.",The picture shows what matters most for matching national rules with EU rules.
"Mapping evidences to the criteria stated in Articles 45 and 46 may be regarded as sufficient for a first
        step since these can be further described within sub criteria and related atomic criteria .",Map evidence to rules.
Atomic criteria: has been convicted of an offence concerning his professional conduct by a judgement which has the force of res judicata,He was found guilty of doing something wrong at work.
"European mapping, economic operator specific: The second step provides a mapping of national
          attestations which evidence criteria defined by Directive 2004/18/EC8, and with a particular focus
          on Articles 45 and 46.",European mapping shows how countries meet certain rules.
"Extended European criteria set and mapping: The third step completes the information support by
          adding all the other criteria in Articles 47 to 50 of the Directive 2004/18/EC on a high level and
          where possible on sub criteria/atomic criteria level.",The third step adds more criteria from the directive.
"The pre-VCD mapping tool introduces a procedure to collect information about the evidences for
      specific Call for Tenders.",Tool collects info on evidence for tenders.
"Thereby the Status quo procedure of section 1.2 remains unchanged, except
      that a pre-VCD mapping exists which is implemented and provided through a European service
      provider9 (see Figure 5).","The status quo stays the same, but there's an extra step for some users who get help from a European company."
"The mapping tool provides information to the economic operator on which
      national attestations of his or her country fulfill the criteria set by the procuring agency in the respective
      country (steps 4, 5).",The tool gives info to the operator about which country documents meet the agency's rules.
"To fulfill a first precondition for a VCD package as introduced in Stages 2 and beyond, the pre-VCD
      mapping tool is the proposed function and the process that allows for its execution.",The tool helps prepare a VCD package.
"For every domain we suppose to get a
      representation of a national index which provides an overview of national criteria demanded in public
      procurement, and how these are evidenced (i.e.",We get a picture for each country showing what it needs in public buying.
"This index also indicates structural data of evidence for example the issuer of the individual
      attestations or statements and the service it may activate for public or reserved access.",This shows who issued papers and what they can be used for.
"In this respect,
      the European selection and exclusion criteria, which are derived from the European Directive
      2004/18/EC, can be considered the reference criteria, while the national criteria which are the basis for
      individual public tenders in respective countries are considered the local criteria.",European rules come from a big law called 2004/18/EC. National rules are used for local tenders.
"Figure 6 depicts the
      general taxonomy for the pre-VCD mapping concept, while Figure 7 shows a detailed taxonomy of the
      concept “evidence”.",Figure 6 shows a big picture and Figure 7 shows details about evidence.
"With this taxonomy, it is possible to map the fact that evidences can either be
      provided by the candidate himself (e.g.",Candidate provides own evidence.
"self-declaration, declaration on oath, solemn statement) or
      specific issuers as certified authorities and/or [authorized] third parties.","Some people say what they mean themselves, or others who are trusted can say it for them."
"Furthermore, evidences may be of different type such as statements, attestations or certificates, as
      indicated in Figure 7.","Evidences can be different types like statements, papers or certificates."
"Overall, the pre-VCD mapping tool supports in the proof of compliance of evidences of one country to
      the requested selection and exclusion criteria of another country via a mapping to the European
      exclusion and selection criteria.",The tool helps countries prove they meet each other's rules.
"The respective retrieval of attestations and statements (6) and the subsequent steps (7-8) remain the
      ones as described in the status-quo description of section 1.2 above.",The same steps stay the same.
"As stated in the introduction, it can be seen as a minimum
        requirement for all Member States participating in the PEPPOL VCD work package.",All countries must follow this rule.
"At this stage, a semantic model is introduced that supports guidance in applying the relevant
        community rules on mutual recognition of evidences (e.g.",A model helps with following rules for sharing evidence.
"a provision of alternative means for evidencing criteria, when foreign economic operators areconsidered;",Alternative ways to show proof for foreign companies.
"An economic operator participating in a tender of a foreign country can quite easily understand the
            requirements (what criteria have to be fulfilled) and decide which are the best national attestations
            (self declarations included) to prove the criteria requested by the contracting authority.",An operator can easily see what's needed and choose the right papers to show it.
"The contracting authority can check through the same mapping mechanism whether the submitted
            attestations express fulfilment with the relevant criteria or requirements.",The authority checks if submissions meet the rules.
"The contracting authority can activate a direct access to attestations that are exposed through
            open services, including the international cross-linking.",The authority can get access to documents online.
"A contracting authority sends a notification on a Call for Tender to a Publication body that publishes
        the call.",An authority sends a notice about a bid to someone who puts it out.
"The Call for Tender contains the definition of evidences and the specific criteria on qualitative
        selection and exclusion that are relevant to this particular call.",The tender explains what evidence is needed.
"If an economic operator decides to participate in a particular Call for Tender he can directly retrieve
        relevant information about evidences and criteria by using the information published in the Call for
        Tender.",He can get info from the call if he joins it.
"In cases below threshold or in the cases where the public notice is partial, the economic
        operator might send a direct request to the contracting authority in order to retrieve the required
        information.",Send a direct request for missing info.
"Having the relevant criteria in place the economic operator will be enabled to get a
        mapping to the national attestations that refer to those criteria via the pre-VCD mapping tool.",The operator can use the tool to find matching national attestations.
"Thesame process can be performed by the contracting authority in order to check whether the submitted
        attestations adequately fulfil certain criteria asked for.",The same process checks if submitted papers meet required rules.
"The pre-condition to the above flow of events is represented by the formal representation of imposed
        criteria, in particular for the qualification segments affecting, the technical, the financial and the quality
        criteria (as per directive 2004/18/EC_Arts.","The condition before this happens is defined rules about what's important (technical, financial, quality)."
"Such formal representation has to be addressed
        along with the setting of the tool.",Formal representation must be fixed with the tool's settings.
"Besides the use of the pre-VCD mapping in actual tendering and procurement procedures, a “system”
        needs to be maintained which implements the mapping of European and national laws, and the
        agreements of mutual recognition among Member States (see use-case diagram depicted in Figure 9).",The system also needs to keep track of European and national laws and agreements between countries.
"Major Feature: pre-VCD mapping tool
        The first feature to be addressed in this stage is the mapping between the criteria of qualitative
        selection and exclusion derived from Articles 45-50 of the Directive 2004/18/EC and the national
        attestations giving evidence to these criteria.",The tool maps European rules to national documents.
"To handle the large set of ruling articles, which may
        especially vary in the national implementations (articles 47-50), arts 45 and 46 shall get a higher
        priority for a smooth implementation at first hand, while arts 47 to 50 will only be selectively
        implemented on the basis of specific and deeper analysis in the PEPPOL pilot contexts.","Handle big rules first, then look at smaller ones later."
"Due to the
        diversity and variability of evidences according to Art 51, this criterion will receive least priority in the
        implementations (if at all taken into consideration).",This criterion gets low priority.
"This mapping includes at first hand an overview and transparency among national evidences and
        European criteria as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7 above, including information about who issues
        specific evidence.",This shows a map with details from countries and Europe.
"Further on, this mapping needs to be implemented in the pre-VCD mapping tool as
        depicted in the use-case diagram in Figure 9, i.e.",Implement it in the pre-VCD tool like Figure 9 shows.
"a list of criteria to be matched is submitted to the
        entity performing the mapping.",Criteria are sent to someone doing matching.
"Using the underlying technology, the mapping is done and its results,
        consisting of a list of the attestations giving evidence to the demanded criteria, can be transferred to a
        requester in case of a public tender.",The results are sent to the person who asked for them.
"These criteria should be derived directly from
          09/11/2009 – version 1.1 (approved by EC)
          the Articles 45-50 of the Directive 2004/18/EC in order to ensure employment in Pan-European public
          procurement procedures.",Criteria should come from Articles 45-50 of Directive 2004/18/EC.
"The right granularity and consistency of criteria will be important to ensure
          legitimacy and to retrieve adequate mapping results.",Good criteria are needed for good results.
"Thus the criteria may have to be iteratively redefined
          according to the results given by specific mappings.",Redefine criteria based on results.
"Superset of evidences: The formal representation will become necessary as a reference data set
              for the mapping operations showing the relationship between all attestations.",The evidence list will be needed to show how things are connected.
"Subset of evidences: The input for the current function (mapping) comes from specific “Calls for
              Tenders” which therewith represent tender-specific requirements.",Input comes from specific tenders with their own needs.
"National requirements of qualitative selection and exclusion for qualitative selection and exclusion
          have to adequately represent the national legal conditions.",National laws must be represented correctly.
"They have to be formulated in a way that
          they can be mapped to common European criteria for qualitative selection and exclusion mentioned by
          the Articles 45-50.",They must fit certain European standards.
"In a first step, all member states do have to establish a mapping of the criteria defined in the relevant
          EU directive 2004/18/EC to the national attestations giving evidence to these criteria.",All countries must match EU rules with their own proof documents.
"To ensure a
          degree of comparability and reliability among the results, the mapping should be based on a common
          template.",Use same template for all.
"For the overall activity it will be important to have the appropriate legal support in order to
          ensure legitimacy of mappings.",Have right lawyers for mapping.
"A template that ensures comparable and reliable mappings between criteria for qualitative
              selection and exclusion and national attestations MUST be defined.",A template must be defined to ensure consistent and reliable choices.
"The resulting template has to be computable by machines and readable by humans allowing the
              assembly of VCD packages through manual and/or automated operations.",Machines can read it and people can too. It helps build VCD packages.
"In order to achieve trust and an agreement on the mutual recognition of qualification documents as
          demanded in the directive, all artefacts and mapping results that relate to the mapping of evidence
          have to be approved from a legal point of view.",All artefacts must be approved legally.
"Compliances to national and European conditions
          must be ensured in particular for the definition of a standard representation of common criteria of
          qualitative selection and exclusion, the definition of a mapping template and the mapping between
          national attestations and the common criteria for qualitative selection and exclusion.",Ensure compliance with rules for defining standards.
"Contracting authorities approaching the tool have to assess the compatibility of the “mapping
              template” with their inspection procedures and code of practice.",Authorities must check if a mapping template fits with their rules.
"The European Commission as well as the National Bodies have to update the mapping model in
              case the legal grounds change or the mapping of European Criteria to national Evidences and
              issuing bodies change.",The Commission and National Bodies must update their map if laws or rules change.
"Hence, adoption and approval procedures have to be defined and enacted in order to install the
              pre-VCD mapping and pre-VCD mapping tool as an official mapping model.",Define and use a new map.
"Precondition: The adoption of the model requires a parallel effort from the legal side to compare
              whether the provisions of existing NPPAs can get a harmonization through the referencing to the
              EU directive.",The model needs help from lawyers to check if old rules can be made similar to new EU rules.
"This is a major requirement to drive the action of contracting authorities that have
              strict obligations to follow while performing in a tendering procedure.",Contractors must follow rules when bidding.
Specify an infrastructure and facility that provides the mapping service,Map server
"The commonly approved national mappings have to be made accessible to the different stakeholders
          as especially economic operators, contracting authorities and national VCD service providers.","Make maps available to people who run businesses, government agencies, and companies that provide services."
"For that
          purpose, a basic infrastructure or system architecture or a mapping facility has to be defined.",Define an infrastructure.
"The
          mapping facility, independent of how such as “system” is actually implemented, has to provide the
          services with regard to the pre-VCD mapping tool",The mapping facility must provide services for a pre-VCD mapping tool.
"In the latter case, one could define that each national system
              only hosts the national mapping or that each one hosts all the different national mappings which
              would make a synchronization of the different systems necessary.",Each country's system can have its own map or all maps.
"A decision to deploy either a centralised or a decentralized infrastructure that provides the
              mapping service MUST be made.",Make a choice for infrastructure.
"The technical means to provide the
              mapping service has to be defined in dependence on the choice of the pilot solution.",Define how to do it based on which way we choose to solve it.
"Another solution could consist of a web-based access to a
              system providing the mapping by querying an underlying database which contains the mapping
              table.",Access a system online and ask it for a map from a database.
"A more advanced solution would be an automated processing of the mapping according to
              the relevant criteria that therefore have to be specified by the contracting authority in a dedicated
              electronic format.",An advanced solution is automatic processing with specific rules given by the person hiring the work in a special computer file.
"In dependence of the choice of infrastructures
              (centralised – decentralized) and the organisation that governs the infrastructure and mapping
              facility it has to be defined who will be responsible to host the mapping facility.",Who will host the mapping facility depends on the infrastructure chosen and how it is organized.
"Define governing model with the necessary status and power to ensure fulfilment of functions like liability, sustainability and maintainability",Define a model that has enough power to do its job well.
"A governing model has to be defined in order to deploy the infrastructure, to maintain its state and
          sustainability over time.",Define a model first to use the infrastructure.
"In this respect the composition, structure and scope of the governing model
          has to be formally defined to ensure fulfilment of functions like liability, sustainability and
          maintainability.",The model must be clearly defined so it can do its job well.
"The dedicated governing model should have the necessary status and power to
          govern its assigned functions.",The model must be in charge.
"Liability: In law a legal liability is a situation in which a person or organisation is financially and
              legally responsible.",Someone or something owes money.
"The liability of the organisation that governs infrastructure and mapping facility
              has to be defined in order to ensure trust into the system and particular mapping results?",The organization's responsibility must be clear so people can trust its maps.
The Liability of organisation that governs the infrastructure and mapping facility MUST be defined,The one who runs infrastructure and maps must be named.
The governing model must ensure that the state of the mapping system will be kept over time.,The model keeps the map state.
"Therefore the mapping system has to be based on the commonly agreed mapping and no
              changes are allowed without a common agreement.",The system must follow agreed rules and not change without everyone agreeing.
"Maintainability: The mapping has to be easily maintainable which could be of interest in the case
              of changes of the legal basis on national or European level.",The map should be easy to change if the rules change.
"A formal procedure has to be found
              how changes are applied to the system.",Find a way to apply changes to the system.
"Moreover an organisation or institution that governs the
              process of change management has to be defined.",Define the group in charge of changing things.
A formal procedure to make changes to the system MUST be defined.,System changes must have a plan.
"Therefore each national service provider that provides a VCD (stage 2-4) and
          all relevant key other stakeholder such as economic operators, contracting authorities and certifiers
          must be able to retrieve the latest mapping information from the mapping facility.",Each provider of VCD services must get the latest map data from the map service.
"In order to derive sufficient mapping information the economic operator has to provide the criteria that
          are relevant to a particular call for tender.",The operator must give the right reasons for a specific bid.
"The overall procedure would be simplified dramatically when
          the relevant criteria for a particular call for tender could be fetched either from a publication body or
          directly from the contracting authority.",Get criteria from publication or authority.
"The interaction with either the publication body or the
          communication with the contracting authority therefore has to be further defined.",Define how to interact with the publisher or contract manager.
"The interaction between mapping facility and Publication Body / Contracting Authority SHOULD be
          defined in order to simplify the procedure to retrieve the relevant criteria for a particular Call for
          Tender.",Map with publication body should define how to get needed info for tender call.
"Attention has to be paid to a number of requirements such as reliability, accessibility, usability,
          maintenance, authenticity, actuality, compliance of mapping to laws and national structures, etc.","Pay attention to things like being reliable, easy to use, and following the rules."
"The
          pre-VCD mapping tool has to be accredited by the European Union and the Member States.",The tool must be approved.
The pre-VCD mapping tool is openly accessible for economic operators and contracting authorities etc.,The tool is free to use for all.
"A powerful search mechanism is implemented to deliver good results when economic operators
              query the pre-VCD mapping tool in order to understand what evidences he can deliver to confer to
              the selection and exclusion criteria set in a public tender in another Member State.",A powerful search helps find good answers when companies look at a map tool to see what proof they need to show for a project bid in another country.
The results are delivered in a format simple to use for the economic operators; e.g.,Results come in an easy-to-use format for businesses.
"a check list of
              evidences he can collect from respective issuing bodies in his country, which fulfil the selection
              criteria and prove the non-conformance with exclusion criteria set by the contracting authority from
              a different Member State.",He gets proof from home countries that meet rules and show something is wrong.
"The Member States shall agree on a common representation format for the information they
          intend to supply into the knowledge base supporting the tool’s operations.",Member states must agree on a way to share information with the tool.
"The Member States shall supply the information generated from the analysis of the national
              context they represent.",Member States must give information about their countries.
"The Member States need to update the mapping in case of any change within a short time frame
              (e.g.",States must update map quickly if anything changes.
"The European service provider for the pre-VCD mapping tool has to ensure that European legal
              changes are implemented quickly (e.g.",European company must implement European law changes fast.
"The European service provider defines the criteria for a “service contract” to be formally agreed
              with “users”.",European provider sets rules for users' contracts.
"It
        requires that the European criteria and national criteria have to be elaborated and agreed upon by the
        different Member States.",European and national rules must be made and agreed on by all countries.
The major advantage and benefits of stage 1 are as follows:,Stage 1 has advantages.
"The major benefit for economic operators lies in the fact that an automatic mapping of criteria to
            national evidences is provided through a pre-VCD mapping tool, thus omitting the need for a
            manual and error-prone selection of appropriate evidences for a particular Call for Tender.",The benefit is that it maps criteria to evidence automatically.
"The
            mapping guarantees that the submitted attestations are mutually recognized if they correspond to
            the mapping information given by the system.",The system recognizes the same things you submit.
"The mutual recognition implies a formal
            commitment by contracting authorities that take part of the service chain, or alternatively by a legal
            enforcement operated by qualified entities.",Authorities agree to work together and follow rules.
"The formal commitment must in turn specify what is
            taken as pure guidance or qualified template.",The commitment must say what is guidance and what is a template.
"The contracting authority can as well use the mapping in order to check if the attestations
            handed in by an economic operator of another country are sufficiently evidencing those selection
            and exclusion criteria defined for the tender.",The contracting authority can use a map to check if foreign companies' documents meet the required rules.
"Through the pre-VCD mapping model, it will also be possible to identify the major issuing bodies
            of particular evidence.",The model can find main sources of evidence.
"Nevertheless this function will not be available for all kinds of attestation
            since there may be too many issuing bodies that provide attestations of the same type (e.g.",This function won't work for all types of proof because there are too many groups giving similar proofs.
"Through the pre-VCD mapping tool, both the economic operator and the contracting authority
            save time and money because they need not to find out by themselves",Both sides save time and money.
"Overall, the pre-VCD mapping tool supports in the proof of compliance of evidences of one country to
            the requested selection and exclusion criteria of another country via a mapping to the European
            exclusion and selection criteria.",The tool helps countries prove they meet each other's rules.
"As mentioned in the vision statement, this stage focuses on the preconditions for a VCD package, and
        hence provides only limited functionality.",This stage is about setting up a VCD package. It does not do much.
"A mapping system is introduced, allowing the mapping of
        criteria to national evidences, thus omitting cumbersome manual and potentially error-prone selection
        of attestations/evidences by the economic operator across borders.","A new system helps map rules to proof from different countries, making it easier and less likely to make mistakes when choosing proof."
"the functions that are not covered
        by this stage:",The rest.
"All documents to be transferred to a foreign
            contracting authority still have to be translated by a certified translator into the appropriate target
            language, if requested by the contracting authority.",Documents go to another country must be translated by a certified person if asked.
"In this stage the economic operator is not supported in creating a VCD package that follows a
            common logic.",The operator does not get help to make a VCD package.
"The VCD package compilation has to be performed by the economic operator
            himself (it is offered in the next stage of the VCD four-stage-model).",The operator must do it himself.
"There is a quality issue to be addressed concerning the acquisition of data for the knowledge
            base, i.e.",Data quality problem needs fixing.
"The contracting authority and economic operator can only retrieve information about the issuing
            bodies of particular evidences when a Member State has specified accredited public issuing
            bodies and recognized private issuing bodies within the national part of the pre-VCD mapping.",The authority and company can get info on who issued certain documents if a country says which ones are trusted.
"Stage 2 requires the establishment of a national VCD service provider which hosts the VCD system in
        order to provide economic operators with the services necessary to create an early VCD package.",Stage 2 needs a national company that runs the VCD system to help businesses make a VCD package quickly.
"The national VCD service provider
        operates the VCD system and takes the role of a trusted third party (TTP) whose services can be
        partially trusted by contracting authorities.",The company runs the VCD system and is a trusted partner for government agencies.
"The VCD package relies on a set of automated, semiautomated
        and manual issuing services which are collected by the VCD system.","The package uses automatic, partly automatic and manual services."
"Thereby issuing
        services that are automated through a direct access to national issuing bodies are reliable to the
        contracting authority while manual and semi-automated issuing service that have to be provided by the
        economic operator are not under control of the national VCD service provider.","The automated services are reliable, but manual ones are not controlled."
"The VCD system wants
        to ensure completeness of a VCD package by acting as a single-point of contact for the economic
        operator that supports him in creating a VCD package from various sources.",The VCD system helps create a complete package.
The VCD system in stage 2 will be capable to compile a VCD package from different types of data.,VCD system can make a package from different data.
"Stage 2 defines the basic structure of a VCD package by including these types of data that give
        evidence for the suitability of an economic operator.",Stage 2 shows what is in a VCD package and why someone is good at business.
"Therewith the contracting authority will be enabled
        to check the validity of the evidences contained within the VCD and whether the requested evidence
        adequately represents the fulfilment of the demanded criteria.",The authority can check if the evidence is valid and good enough.
"Thereby translation of evidences may
        be still necessary and has to be performed by the economic operator in dependence on national legal
        and organizational requirements because the VCD package does not provide any standardised
        context-specific data which provide common semantics.",The translation needs to be done again if there is no standard data.
"Checks concerning the content of the
        evidences are therewith not possible in this stage, as there is no context specific data available.",No checks can be done on evidence content because we don't have enough information.
"Nevertheless a VCD simple package provides a set of other types of data that are introduced in the list
        below:",It gives some other kinds of data.
"Structural VCD package data: Data that describes the VCD-Package as a whole, e.g.",VCD package data describes the whole package.
Tender specific evidence: Data that describe tender specific aspects e.g.,Show specific proof.
"Economic operator evidence: Data describing the individual situation of the economic operator
            e.g.",Economic operator's details.
"The use case description of stage 2 contains several sub-diagrams that describe interactions that are
        needed firstly to authenticate to the systems and secondly to create, transport and view a VCD simple
        package.",Stage 2 describes how to log in and work with a special kind of file.
"The Identity and access management is an official procedure that handles roles for authorisation
          external to the VCD system and involves three actors, the economic operator, an officer and the VCD
          system itself as shown in Figure 11.","The process manages roles for permission and includes three people: the company, an official, and the system."
"Economic operators have to apply for a VCD account and therefore they have to provide sensitive
          economic operator data (for example by uploading attestations to verify these data).",Economic operators must give their details to get a VCD account.
"An officer has to verify whether the provided data belongs to the
          economic operator and has to assure its correctness because either the VCD packaging service would
          not work or would deliver incomplete or wrong results.","The officer checks if the data is correct and belongs to the right person, so the package service works properly."
"After verification the officer creates a VCD
          account where sufficient data about the economic operator is stored.",Officer makes account for economic operator.
"In addition, identity and access
          management requires the possibility to delete an account within the VCD system and an official
          procedure to apply for a modification of the VCD account.",Delete account in VCD system and change it if needed.
"An economic operator can authenticate to
          the VCD system only when the economic operator has sufficient user rights (e.g.",Economic operator can use VCD system if they have enough permission.
"authorized
          representative of economic operator) provided by identity and access management as shown in Figure
          12.",Authorized person from a company.
"The VCD system creates a
          suggestion for compilation according to the results provided by the pre-VCD mapping tool and in turn
          the economic operator can edit and confirm the compilation suggestion that is given by the VCD
          system as shown in Figure 13.",The VCD system makes a suggestion based on the results. The operator can then change or agree with it.
"Evidence and structural evidence data is
          provided by issuing bodies which can submit evidence and structural evidence data to the VCD
          system via an interface.",Bodies give data to VCD system.
"An important remark therefore is that economic operators can take the role of
          an issuing body by submitting for example candidate statements, manually collected evidence or
          translations of evidence.","Economic operators can be an issuing body and submit statements, evidence, or translations."
"The interface to submit evidence is defined through a service definition that
          allows adding specific structural evidence data that belongs to that evidence.",Submit evidence data goes in a special place.
"The collection of
          evidence is finalized when all required evidences are submitted and this requires waiting for those
          evidences that have to be provided manually or semi-automatically.",Evidence is finished when all needed papers are in.
"The VCD system can now compile 
          the VCD package and creates a set of structural VCD package data that belong to the compilation
          process.",The VCD system compiles the VCD package.
"The economic operator can submit the VCD simple package to the contraction authority by using the
          VCD transportation system which is part of the PEPPOL infrastructure.",The operator submits a package to an authority using a transport system.
"For using the VCD
          transportation system of WP8, both economic operators and contracting authorities have to
          authenticate to have access.",Use VCD transport to get in.
"An important remark hereby is the usage of procurement platforms
          where bids are typically uploaded according to a given Call for Tender.",Bids go on a platform after a call.
"The transportation system of
          WP8 used by the VCD should be able to provide a possibility to send the VCD package directly to the
          contracting authority either by utilizing the upload functionality of a procurement platform or by directly
          sending the VCD to the contracting authority by using other means provided by the transportation
          system or typically used by the contracting authority.","WP8's transport system should allow sending packages directly to the buyer, either through an upload platform or by mail."
"It is also important to state that the transportation
          system does not necessarily have to be used by the economic operator.",The system doesn't need to be used by the person in charge of money.
"The economic operator
          receives a VCD package by the VCD system and it is up to his choice how to submit the VCD package
          to the contracting authority.",The operator gets a package from the system and decides what to do with it.
"After retrieving the VCD package from economic operators, contracting authorities may have to
          authenticate to the VCD viewing system in order to view the VCD package.",Get the package and then log in to see it.
"In contrast economic
          operators do not have to authenticate to the VCD viewing system because they are taking the role of
          an owner of the VCD package.",Economic operators don't need to log in to watch a VCD.
"The VCD viewing system has to fulfil certain sub-functionalities for displaying the different kinds of
          data that are contained within a VCD package.",The VCD viewer shows different types of data in a package.
"the TED ID to which the VCD package is related to),",The ID for the VCD package.
"This subsection lists the major features, requirements and quality attributes that are significant for a
        VCD simple package.",This lists main things needed in a VCD package.

The choice of how to submit the VCD package to the contracting authority MUST be the one that is preferred by the economic operator.,Choose the way you send the package that saves money.
Beside the transportation system (WP8) the economic operator SHOULD be able to use other electronic channels for submitting a VCD package to the contracting authority.,The operator should use other electronic channels to submit a VCD package.
It MUST be clarified which possibilities exist to utilize the infrastructure for submitting a VCD package directly to procurement platforms (e.g.,We need to know what options are available to use infrastructure to send a VCD package straight to buying websites.
The transportation system MUST ensure that the VCD package is being delivered to the contracting authority,Transportation system must deliver VCD package to contractor.

"The major aim of stage 2 is to draft logical systems that enable economic operators to create simple
        VCD packages and to submit them to contracting authorities.",Stage 2 aims to make simple packages for businesses to sell to government agencies.
"Thereby stage 2 focuses on the
        necessary different logical systems that either provide major functionalities with regard to creating and
        viewing a VCD packages (VCD system) or which support the entire process such as authentication
        (Identity and Access management), transportation (VCD transportations system) or translation (VCD
        translation system).","Stage 2 focuses on systems that help create, view, and manage VCD packages."
"The general assumption of stage 2 is that the former pre-VCD mapping tool (stage
        1) will be utilized as a module that is adequately integrated into the VCD system.",The old tool will be used in the new system.
"Stage 2 also introduces the idea of a national VCD service provider which operates the different
        services necessary to create and view a VCD package.",Stage 2 has a company that makes and shows VCD packages.
"The national VCD service provider will provide
        a single-point of access to several attestations and issuing services that are electronically available.",The company will give one way to get many things online.
"Nevertheless it will be necessary to include other evidences that have to be provided semiautomatically
        or manually by the economic operator.",It will need other evidence from the company.
"It also cannot be guaranteed that each
        evidentiary document required according to the criteria stated in the Call for Tender by the contracting
        authority can be pointed at with a particular mapping results of the pre-VCD mapping tool since some
        evidence diverge too much in their contents and scope.",Some documents may not match exactly because they have different content.
"In those cases the VCD system will provide
        the possibility to add those documents into the VCD simple package through placeholders which may

        have a very generic grounding for mapping defined through an abstract class of documents (e.g.",The system will add documents to the package using placeholders.
"When summarizing those points it
        can be generally stated that a VCD at stage 2 and beyond still relies on several manual processes that
        have to be generated by the economic operator and which cannot be automated in short or medium
        term.",VCDs after stage 2 need human help.
"However, a reduced scope of a VCD is necessary in order to provide the possibility to submit a
        VCD that has a sufficient level of completeness.",A VCD needs to be limited so it can be complete enough to send.
"Another aim of stage 2 is to differentiate, define and structure the types of data that will constitute a
        VCD package.",Stage 2 aims to identify what kinds of data are in a VCD package.
"The VCD package
        contains similar structural fields which likewise describe the evidences contained in it in similar
        manner, order and style.",The package has same parts that say what's inside it in the same way.
"Having similar structural layout of a VCD it will be easier to understand the
        contents of it and potentially to translated those structural key information from the language of the
        issuer or economic to the language of the contracting authority.","It has a similar structure, so it's easy to understand what's inside and translate important parts into another language."
"Nevertheless a translation of the
        contents of evidentiary documents is not focussed at in this stage and has to be provided manually by
        the economic operator through adding translations into the VCD simple package.",The translation of documents needs to be done manually by the company.
"The VCD package only focus on major functions that are necessary to create such a
        package and doesn’t make use of other service that are introduced in the subsequent phases such as,
        recompiling an existing VCD package, usage of context-specific data and merging VCD packages of
        different economic operators into a single one.",The package only does what is needed to work.
"The recompilation of existing VCD packages increases
        the maintainability of a VCD for the economic operator by for example indicating which evidence has
        to be replaced by a new one and which evidence has to be additionally provided in case preparing a
        bid for a different Call for Tender.",Recompiling old packages makes it easier for companies to keep their VCDs up to date.
"The usage of context-specific data thereby is an important precondition
        since these data can provide real-time information about the status of contents of the VCD
        which is needed in terms of making update proposals.",Using specific data helps make updates.
"Also the merging of different VCD packages
        into a single unit to be used when consortia which prepare a bid as a multi-party group is not
        addressed in stage 2.",Merging different VCD packages into one unit for multi-party bids is not covered in stage 2.
Updating an existing VCD package whenever one or more evidences are outdated.,Update old package when evidence is old.
"This could be
            done by checking whether evidences are outdated or not, retrieving the outdated evidences again
            and creating a new VCD package, which then contains the newly obtained evidences and those
            evidences from the original VCD, which are still valid.","Check old evidence, get new one, make new package with both."
"This use case contains the necessary steps an economic operator performs to create a new VCD
          advanced package.",Create a new package.
"This use case is similar to the use case “Create VCD simple package” of stage 2
          but adds the necessary functionality regarding context specific data and merging existing VCD
          packages into the new VCD advanced package.","This use case is like another one, but it's different because it handles special data and combines old packages."
"This use case contains the necessary steps an economic operator performs to re-compile an existing
          VCD package into a new VCD advanced package.",An operator makes an old package into a new one.
"a consortium, contractor-subcontractor-relationships) into one VCD package, the economic
          operator has to be able to provide these VCD packages to the VCD system.",The operator must give VCD packages to the system.
"The stage 2-collection process for evidence and structural evidence data has to be extended to
          include the collection and processing of context specific data.",Collect more data.
"It is important to understand that context
          specific data cannot be automatically extracted from unstructured data as scanned copies or text
          documents as this could lead to incorrect results due to the non-deterministic behaviours of such
          extraction mechanisms (OCR, etc).",Context-specific data can't be automatically taken from unstructured data.

              the structure is consistent with an agreed upon schema.",XML files made by a computer system are okay if they follow rules.
"This approach requires an
              additional level of trust into the national VCD service provider acting as Trusted Third party as he
              will be responsible for the correctness of the context specific data itself and not just only for the
              compliance of the processes, which are executed by the VCD services.",The approach needs a trusted third-party to ensure correct data.
"In order to merge VCD packages of several economic operators, acting as a single economic operator

"In stage 1 contracting authorities are required to trust the provided evidences, issuing bodies, translators and the correctness of the international mapping","Contracting authorities must trust evidence, issuers, translators and maps."
In stage 2 contracting authorities are required to trust the national VCD service providers as they are responsible for the compilation of VCD packages containing valid (not outdated) evidences or other evidences which are suitable to give evidence for the required criteria,Contracting authorities must use the national VCD service.
In stage 3 contracting authorities are required to expand their trust into the national VCD service providers as they are responsible for the compilation of VCD packages containing context specific data which augment the evidence content.,"Contracting authorities must add national VCD service providers to their trust in stage 3, as they make VCD packages with extra information that helps prove things."

"The Virtual Company Dossier than consists of
        some references to attestation services which mandate a contracting authority to obtain information
        directly.",The company dossier has references to get info directly.
"A direct exchange between trusted attestation services and a contracting authority would provide
        many opportunities with regard to an increase of the actuality of evidence, to lower the transaction
        costs of the parties involved and to reduce the time to create a VCD.",Trusted services talk directly to authorities to make things faster and cheaper.
"Nevertheless such direct
        exchange is very difficult to implement technically because a lot of entities and attestation services
        have to be federated.",It's hard to make this work because many groups need to join together.
"Finally a semantic pre-condition would be that evidence
        is provided in a common electronic format that allows an automated transformation into the requestor’s
        target language.",Evidence should be in a standard digital format that can easily be translated into the requested language.

"We suggest that a national VCD service provider uses a temporary storage to hold the
        attestations instead of compiling them directly into a VCD.",Use a temporary storage for attestations instead of putting them in a VCD.
"The VCD then only consists of a number of
        flags that denote an evidence as well as structural data of evidence and context specific data plus a
        reference to retrieve the attestation on demand at the time of awarding.","The VCD has flags showing proof, details, and special info, with a link to get more proof when needed."
"Therefore it would be
        important that the evidence requested is valid at the time of awarding or when the call for tender is
        closed.",Evidence must be valid by the deadline.
"Such model of indirect exchange would also make it easier for a
        national VCD service to establish an official list of approved economic operators in accordance with
        Article 52 (1) of Directive 2004/18/EC.",This model makes it easy to create a list of approved companies.
"The national VCD service provider could use the information
        within its storage to maintain such lists.",The company can use its own data.
"Evidence that is sufficiently described through context specific
        data could then for example be automatically validated by a national VCD service provider by putting

"Stage 4 therewith improves the level of support for the economic operator since the need and burden
        to present specific attestations to the contracting authority will be eliminated.",Stage 4 makes it easier for the company because they don't have to prove things anymore.
"Stage 4 therewith fulfils
        the paradigm shift where a contracting authority only asks for the fulfilment of certain criteria and not
        for the delivery of specific evidence.","Stage 4 just checks if things meet some rules, not specific proof."
"Stage 4 introduces the ""on-demand"" idea

"In
        order to ensure the level of completeness, the VCD network package needs to be extended stepwise
        by including evidences which are sufficiently described through agreed and standardised contextspecific
        data and structural data of evidence (and which can easily be validated by the national VCD
        service provider when he accredits economic operators according to Article 52).",The package needs to add more details step by step.
"We propose the
        following major building blocks to establish a VCD networked package:",We suggest these main parts for a connected package.
"The

            individual basis at the time of awarding.",The VCD has instructions for getting documents from the contractor when a contract is awarded.
"The reference or processing instruction includes a
            mechanism to grant access rights to the contracting authority in order to retrieve these attestations
            within a certain period of time.",The instruction lets the contracting authority get the attestations quickly.
"When the National VCD Service Provider receives a
            valid request at the time of awarding from a contracting authority mandated by the economic
            operator he delivers the requested evidence to the contracting authority.","When they get a good request, they send the proof to the person who asked for it."
"Evidences (and in particular those that
            are sufficiently described through context specific data) could be validated by a national VCD
            service provider by putting validation values into a VCD.",A national VCD service provider can validate evidence with a VCD.
"Stage 4 does not contain a modelled use case diagram that clarifies the system interaction and a
      detailed description of requirements because it mainly relies on the functions introduced in the
      previous stages and there are no pilots yet for this stage.","Stage 4 doesn't have a diagram or details about what the system does, because it uses things from earlier stages and there are no tests yet."
"Functions in

The VCD system MUST provide a functionality that initiates a conflict resolution process between economic operator and contracting authority if errors occur or when certain attestation or a translation cannot be delivered on demand.,"If there are problems, the system must help resolve them between the person running the business and the government agency."
The VCD system SHOULD provide a functionality to approve attestations through validation data and to make this approval visible within a VCD networked package when a National VCD Service provider takes the role of a national validation point in accordance with Article 52 (1) of Directive 2004/18/EC and EFTA EEA Committee decision 68/2006.,The system should show approval for attestations within a package when a country's service provider checks them.
There MUST be an access policy that is issued by the economic operator that mandates a contracting authority to request attestation from the national VCD service provider on demand.,The operator must give a policy saying when the buyer can ask for proof from the government service.
This may include creating contracting authority specific or VCD specific references in order to identify a mandate that has been given by the economic operator to this contracting authority for retrieving attestation or even updates on it.,The contracting authority gets information from an economic operator about a task they were given.
National and local political commitments and service-level agreements MUST ensure that consensuses on roles and responsibilities are built with regard to this solution and in particular the National Service Providers who delivers attestations on demand.,"National and local leaders must agree on roles and responsibilities for this solution, especially for those who give proof when asked."
"There MUST be a service-level agreement between the parties involved (Economic Operators, Contracting authorities, National Service Providers, and Trusted Attestation Service) about the response time of a delivery of attestations and data availability.",There must be an agreement on how fast deliveries are made and when data is available.
"There MUST be a service-level agreement between the parties involved (Economic Operators, Contracting authorities, National Service Providers, and Trusted Attestation Service) about conflict resolution that describe what to do when errors occur or when attestation or translations cannot be delivered “on demand”.",There must be an agreement on how to resolve conflicts.
The attestations where an agreement on context specific formats can be reached most easily SHOULD be included first into the network.,Include easy agreements first.
Legal systems MUST ensure that context specific data and validation values have an equivalent value to the provision of conventional / traditional attestations.,Data must be the same as usual proof.
The national procurement law MUST ensure that National Service Provider can act as national validation points in accordance with Article 52 (1) of Directive 2004/18/EC for economic operators.,The law must let the provider be a validation point for companies.
Liability issues of the National Service Providers MUST be clarified when they act as national validation points in accordance with Article 52 (1) of Directive 2004/18/EC for economic operators.,National providers must clarify their liability issues when acting as national validation points.
"Stage 4 relies on several functionalities or concepts that have been already addressed and described
      in previous stages.",Stage 4 uses things we've talked about before.
Stage2: Compiling a VCD from several different kinds of data.,Compiling a video CD from different data.
Stage2 and 3: Implementation of direct access to issuing bodies and further description of interfaces to provide structural data of evidence and context specific data.,Stage 2 and 3: Get data directly from the people who issue it and describe how to get more information about a case.
Stage 3: A semantic standardisation of context specific data that describe the major contents of attestations which have a relatively uniform structure and uniform contents.,Stage 3: Standardize data about things with same structure and content.
For example a balance sheet could be much more easily represented electronically if a specific tender would only demand to fulfil a certain range of capital (e.g.,A balance sheet can be shown easier on computer if it only needs some money.
until 1 Million / from 1 Million to 10 / …) that has to be met by the economic operator.,"Until 1 million or from 1 million to 10, a condition must be met."
Stage 3: Possibilities to update a VCD and therewith enabling the national VCD service provider to take the role of a validation point in order to implement Article 52 of directive 2004/18/EC.,Update VCD to enable national provider to validate according to EU rules.
This first approach is extremely ambitious but the only way to always access actualised data.,This approach is very big and the only way to get real data.
This second approach could be implemented with lower efforts but leads to the situation that the data provided by the VCD package is in the end as actual as the data provided by a VCD package that is compiled using the concept from stage 3.,This way needs less work and gives same results as the other way.
"Already in 2003, the
    EC has published a working document, the European Interoperability Framework (EIF), where the
    authors defined IOP as “the means by which the interlinking of systems, information and ways of
    working, whether within or between administrations, nationally or across Europe, or with the enterprise
    sector, occurs” ((IDABC 2004), pp.","The EC published a document in 2003 that defined IOP as how systems, information, and work styles connect."
"The document recalls IOP needs on technical, semantic and
    organizational layer with a rather wide understanding of IOP (IDABC 2004).",The document talks about IOP needs in different ways.
"In late 2008 a draft for a
    revised European Interoperability Framework was published by IDABC extending the requirement for
    IOP to five levels12:
    The aim of this chapter is to draw a picture about the current situation applied in the countries with
    regard to potentially placement of a VCD in the MS according to the European Interoperability
    Framework version 2 (EIF2):","In 2008, IDABC published a draft for a revised framework."
The legal framework thereby refers to appropriate synchronization of the legislation in the cooperating MS so that electronic data originating in any given MS is accorded to proper legal weight and recognition wherever it needs to be used in other MS.,The law makes sure that data from one country gets the same respect as data from another country when it's used in a different country.
"This includes rules with regard to tendering, submission and awarding including certificates and attestations that are typically required and their mapping to evidences and exclusion and selection criteria from a legal point of view.",This includes rules for bidding and choosing winners.
The organizational framework then refers to the processes by which different organizations such as different public administrations collaborate to achieve their mutually agreed eGovernment service-related goals.,Organizations work together to reach shared goals.
"This includes best practices for tendering, submission and awarding derived from activities such as stakeholder analysis and stakeholder questionnaires that have been developed.",This includes good ways to do things like asking people questions and analyzing their answers.
"The semantic framework ensures that the precise meaning of exchanged information (concepts, organization, services, etc) is preserved and well understood.",The framework keeps meanings clear.
"The use cases of the stages
        above show the actors that are involved and have to be addressed through the organisational
        framework e.g.",The stages above show who is involved and needs to be helped.
"Within the project it will be necessary to manage these different kinds of stakeholders by
        adequately integrating them into the project.",Manage stakeholders in the project.
"Thereby it will be of importance to define their specific
        role and their importance for our work package within the lifetime of the project.",Define their role and importance in our project.
"Networks of gathering
        evidences are complex to handle because there are several stakeholders to consider.",Handling evidence networks is hard due to many people involved.
"To avoid
        problems of involvement a clear approach of stakeholder analysis is needed.",Avoid problems by analyzing stakeholders.
"WP2 can only provide
        guidance to this since it will be a national responsibility.",WP2 gives advice on this because it's someone else's job.
"Austria for example has set up a physical
        stakeholder forum that informs key stakeholder in regular time intervals about the results of PEPPOL.",Austria tells important people about PEPPOL results regularly.
"Next to this the WP2 team of Austria is building up a participation platform13 where latest results are
        presented and can be further discussed within forums and mini surveys.",Austria's WP2 team builds a website for sharing results and talking about them.
"Each member state has to
        define its own strategy to involve stakeholders during the lifetime of the project.",Each country decides how to work with others during a project.
"WP2 has developed a
        template for stakeholder management that may provide guidance for this.",WP2 made a plan to help with stakeholder management.
"To ensure a wide acceptance of the solutions provided by WP2 among stakeholders we have to
        prevent changes in national procedures and infrastructures but to utilize them as much as possible.",We must keep national procedures and infrastructure unchanged while using them as much as possible.
"In
        stages 2, 3 and 4 it will be necessary to establish a national service provider who will take care about
        critical VCD processes and therewith ensure legitimacy, trust and appropriate change management.","It will need a national service provider in stages 2, 3 and 4."
"These entities then need to
        be included into a list of recognized private and public issuing bodies which will be an important part
        when defining structural data of evidence (e.g.",These entities must be added to a list of known issuers.
"A national VCD
        application may list several different issuing bodies that provide the same attestation.",One app lists many groups that give same proof.
"However the choice which
        attestation is most appropriate should be left to the economic operator but this decision may be
        supported through displaying these different characteristics.",The choice of what to show depends on the company.
"If an economic operator for example
        decides to rely on a manual issuing service that cannot be directly invoked by a national service
        provider it is the responsibility of the economic operator to provide this attestation and act as issuing
        body by uploading it to the system of the national service provider in order to create a VCD package.",The economic operator must upload the attestation to the national service provider's system.
"National solutions therefore may vary due to freedom of implementing
        national solutions but conformance to key issues should ensure their interoperability.",National solutions can be different because countries are free to choose how they implement them. But they must still work together on important issues.
"A key issue for
        example is the pre-VCD mapping tool and it should be integrated into any national solutions either as
        a module or as interface to query results for the mapping of evidences among member states.",The pre-VCD mapping tool should be part of national solutions.
"To
        enable automated information processing on the basis of the pre-VCD mapping tool within national
        solutions additional structured information has to be defined within the Call for Tender that enables the
        retrieval of qualification and selection criteria from contracting authorities.",Enable automated info processing in national solutions by defining extra details in the Call for Tender so contractors can find qualification and selection criteria.
"A contracting authority
        therefore has to specify a relevant criteria subset within a Call for Tender which can then for example
        be referred to by an economic operator by providing the ID of a Call for Tender to the national solution.",The contracting authority must specify the relevant criteria in the call for tender and use its ID.
Two phased tendering is not explicitly foreseen by the VCD even if it might be used for this purpose.,VCD does not mention two-phased tendering.
"In
        most cases we do not see great efforts for economic operators in two-phased since many countries
        only required the submission of self-declarations.",Mostly we don't see big efforts from companies because they just send forms.
"None of the above mentioned solutions explicitly requires implementing Article 52 of directive
        2004/18/EC.",None require Article 52.
"In stages 3 and 4 a higher “level of
        decision making” is promoted and we see especially the provision of context specific data (stage 3)
        and the on demand approach (stage 4) as a pre-conditions that ease the establishment of lists of
        approved economic operators across borders.","In stages 3 and 4, decision making gets better. We see providing specific data (stage 3) and being able to ask for things when needed (stage 4) as helping to make lists of approved companies that can work together across borders."
"However if there is a country that wishes to enable
        such a proof in the VCD it can be done before but will require several manual efforts.",It can be done but takes effort.
"The requirements have to be fulfilled or further analysed
        and specified in the project lifetime in order to further draft the organisational framework for a VCD to a
        greater extend.",Requirements must be met or studied to create an organizational plan for a VCD.

"Pilots implemented in stages 1, 2, 3 and 4 produce VCD artefacts that enable matching between
          attestations and certain criteria across borders and the implementation of the VCD package.",Pilots make a special kind of error that helps match things from different countries.
"This does
          not include that any check or proof of conformance is performed by any national service provider who
          provides a VCD package with regard to the contents of the package and its attestation as for example

          are derived from Article 45-50 and which are partially described in the Eligibility of Tenders.",National criteria must match European criteria based on Articles 45-50 and the Tender Eligibility rules.
"Description
          Any instance of a VCD requires to be defined for a particular economic operator.",A VCD must be defined for an economic operator.
"Next to this it is the
          aim of the work package to make each VCD specific to a particular Call for Tender.",This aims to make each VCD specific to one call.
"The pre-VCD
          mapping tool therefore will provide sufficient support and has to be integrated into a VCD system.",The tool will help with a VCD system.
A unique VCD identifier needs to be established.,A special ID is needed.
"Description
          A VCD package will show its full potential only when all requested evidences (all that are necessary to
          prove all the requested criteria) are contained within it.",A VCD package works best with all needed proof.
"From a very pragmatic point
          of view it seems reasonable to focus on a subset of attestations in a first step and to complete the
          VCD Package later on.","Focus on some examples first, then finish the package later."
"It is also reasonably to define, where and when permitted, a default packaging
          list of tender independent criteria to be served without the burden of reading or interpreting the “Call
          for Tender”.",Define a standard list of requirements that can be used without reading the full request.
"Requirement
          When implementing any tool, system or service WP2 MUST focus on mandatory requirements and
          evidences mentioned in Articles 45 and 46 first since theses Articles are not tender-specific and
          therewith relevant for nearly all tenders.","When using a tool, system or service, focus on essential rules and proof first because they apply to almost all tenders."
"Measurement
          Any definition, specification, modelling or implementation will first focus on Article 45 to 46

          The mapping between evidences via requirements MUST have set a primary focus on the mandatory
          requirements and evidences of a VCD.",Measurement focuses on Articles 45-46.
"Measurement
          The definition, specification, modelling or implementation of the pre-VCD mapping tool will focus on
          Articles 45 to 46
          Requirement
          Articles 47 to 50 open a wide range of different criteria which are tender- and country-specific thus
          they MUST be added stepwise to the pre-VCD mapping tool (which may require a higher-level
          mapping).",The definition will focus on articles 45 to 46. It must add specific criteria from articles 47 to 50 step by step.
"Requirement
          Any VCD system SHOULD provide the opportunity to the economic operator to produce a complete
          VCD even if there are several issuing services that are not under control of a national service provider,
          do not have specific mapping to other documents defined in the pre-VCD mapping tool and have to be
          provided by the economic operator manually.",The system should let the company make a complete VCD even if some services are not controlled by one provider.
"Description
          Since the completeness of a VCD package should be ensured but a complete mapping of evidence
          may not be provided as especially the criteria of Articles 49 to 50 of the directive are unstructured and
          much dependent on tender-specific requirements it has to be possible to define placeholders where a
          contracting authority may complete the mapping on individual basis through uploading evidence to
          these placeholders.","A VCD package should be complete, but criteria for completeness are unclear. A contracting authority can add missing information later."
"Description
          The VCD system should provide a functionality that allows issuing bodies to submit evidence to it.",Bodies can send proof.
Therefore interfaces to submit evidence to the VCD system have to be defined.,Interfaces must be defined for submitting evidence to the VCD system.
"Thereby manual, semiautomated
          and automated interfaces have to be separated
          Requirement
          Interfaces to submit evidence to the VCD system have to be defined along with common semantics in
          order to allow issuing bodies to further specify evidence with regard to structural data, context specific
          data and validation values.","Manual, semi-automated, and automated interfaces must be separated. Interfaces for submitting evidence to the VCD system must be defined with common meanings so that issuing bodies can add more details about structure, context, and validation."

          parts are mandatory and ensure semantic interoperability of VCD packages.",Define what's needed for different stages of growth so they can work together.
"The below mentioned
          requirements provide guidance for and further explain where mandatory and optional requirements
          can be found.",These requirements tell you where to find them.
"Requirement
          The pre-VCD mapping tool (Stage 1) MUST be filled with instances (defined) by every Member State
          since Stage 1 is a precondition for any other stage.",Every country must fill in the first stage of the tool before moving on to the next stages.
"Measurement

          Requirement
          The VCD simple package (Stage 2) lays the basic ground for the creation of VCDs and the
          implementation of other services mentioned in stages 3 and 4 so the key concepts of Stage 2 MUST
          be implemented in each Member States.",The tool helps countries prepare for something called VCDs.
"Measurement
          Key concepts such as structural data of evidence applied to VCD package
          Requirement
          Stage 3 (VCD advanced package) and stage 4 (VCD networked package) introduce a set of optional
          functions that SHOULD be considered by each Member State when implementing a VCD.",Measure structural data for VCD packages.
"Requirement
          The stages are logically built upon each other but it MUST be possible to implement certain features of
          stage 4 if the necessary requirements for this are fulfilled in the lower stages even if maybe not all

"The validation value should
          be able to prove conformance to criteria of qualitative exclusion and selection unambiguously.",The value must clearly show it meets certain rules.
"This
          principle should be applied wherever possible for example:
          • The economic operator has to prove that he paid fiscal taxes according to national regulations – in
          this case a “Yes/No statement” will be sufficient.",The operator must show they paid taxes as required by law.
"• The economic operator has to provide balance sheet or extracts from it in order to proof its
          economic or financial standing – in this case the whole attestation (balance sheet or extracts of it)
          has to be delivered.",The operator must give a balance sheet or parts of it to show their financial situation.
"- If sufficient context specific data format for representing those information unambiguously is
          available it may be applied for stage 4.","If we have enough clear data, we can use it in stage 4."
this has a high priority to be included into stage 3 and stage 4.,This is high priority for stages 3 and 4.
"Requirement
          If attestations are described sufficiently in multiple lingual versions they SHOULD be included first to
          stages 3 and 4.",Include translations first if descriptions are good enough.
"Requirement
          If the prove concentrates on qualitative aspects (e.g.",If it focuses on quality.
"provide balance sheet or extracts from it in order
          to proof its economic or financial standing) then the validation value cannot be applied.",Provide a balance sheet to show financial standing.
"Instead such
          an attestation can be included into VCD stages 3 and 4 if it is sufficiently described through context
          specific data in multilingual versions (e.g.",Include attestation in VCD stages 3 and 4 with enough context-specific data in multiple languages.
"Description
          “A classification scheme is the descriptive information for an arrangement or division of objects into
          groups based on characteristics that the objects have in common”20.",Objects are grouped together based on what they share.
"“Classification schemes and code lists conveys semantics to the objects so they are a key factor to
          achieve semantic interoperability.",Code lists help things understand each other.
"As it is quite
          complex to establish a common and unique classification scheme cross-border and cross-sector,
          business document instances should be carry metadata about classification schemes they use.”
          (Bausa O. and Boujraf A.","It's hard to agree on a way to classify things across borders and industries, so documents should include information about how they were classified."
"Supporting pan-European procurement and implementing services to enable pan-European
        deployment of evidences is the major goal of PEPPOL WP2.",Enable European use of evidence.
"Any WP2 solution therefore needs to
        comply with the legal requirements concerning selection and exclusion criteria in public procurement
        defined by the European procurement directives and in national implementing legislation.",Needs to follow EU rules about choosing who gets a contract.
"Compliance with these regulations will ensure acceptance of a solution and will ensure and help to
        establish a ""level of trust"" between the parties involved.",Following these rules helps people accept your solution and trust each other.
"Therefore a comprehensive analysis of the
        relevant legal regulation has to take place.",We need to analyze the laws.
"To get an overview on the legal requirements and
        regulations on different levels the following sources have to be analysed:",Analyze these sources to understand legal requirements.
"The requirements have to be fulfilled or further
        analysed and specified in order to further draft the legal framework for a VCD to a greater extent.",Requirements must be met or studied more before making a law.
"Description
          The principle of equal treatment is often mentioned by the directive 2004/18/EC for example in
          connection with contracts that should be awarded on the basis of objective criteria which ensure
          compliance with the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and equal treatment and which
          guarantee that tenders are assessed in conditions of effective competition.",The principle of fair treatment is mentioned for example in contracts where things are chosen based on clear rules to make sure everyone is treated equally and fairly.
"Therefore Article 52(5) states that “economic operators from other Member
          States may not be obliged to undergo such registration or certification in order to participate in a public
          contract.",Economic operators from other countries do not have to register or get certified to take part in a government contract.
"Requirement
          The VCD SHOULD support that economic operators from foreign member states may not be treated
          harder than own member state’s economic operators.",Foreign companies should not be treated unfairly compared to local ones.
"It has to be defined whether a VCD
          package can have its own validity or if its validity is only based on the contained information.",Can it have its own date or just use what's inside?

"Description
          The use of context-specific formats that include multi-lingual versions of attestations should ensure
          that an automated transformation from one language version into another language version delivers
          results that have from the viewpoint of official translations, a similar legal status.",Use same format for all languages to make sure translations are equal in law.
"Requirement
          The provision of attestations that are available in context-specific formats including multi-lingual
          versions and their transformation into any target language has to guarantee similar legal status and
          effect is reached compared to official translation.",The provision must be the same as an official translation.
"Description
          A contracting authority sends a contract notice to a Publication body that publishes the call.",The authority sends a notice to the publisher.
"The Call
          for Tender should contain the definition of specific criteria on qualitative selection and exclusion that
          are relevant to this particular procurement.",The call must say what makes something good or bad for this buy.
"If an economic operator decides to participate in a particular procurement procedure he can directly

            conformance with given criteria specified by another Member State.",Not all countries provide proof of meeting certain standards.
"Thus only the economic operators
            from Member States where such attestations are available can provide these attestations.",Only companies from countries that have this proof can give it.
"Other

"Description
          In many countries there are certain regulations with regard to evidences that have to be considered.",Some countries have rules about evidence.
"For example in some countries it is not allowed to directly issue an extract from the register of
          conviction to the economic operator but to directly deliver these evidence to the requesting authority.","In some countries, you can't give a copy of a criminal record directly to a business, but must give it to the person asking for it instead."
"Data

          in a way in which individuals or entities can enforce the control of information about themselves.",Data protection law controls what happens to your personal info.
"Although data protection does not directly refer to principles like data privacy, data confidentiality, data
          availability, non-repudiation of data, data integrity and data security these principles are strongly
          connected to data protection.","Data protection is related to other important ideas like privacy, secrecy, being available, not denying something was sent, keeping it whole, and making sure it's secure."
"Therefore the rules and regulations in each Member State have to be analysed with regard
          to the prospects of separating these two parts from each other.",Each country's rules must be checked to separate these two parts.
"This may also include for example to
          submit a VCD package via the PEPPOL infrastructure while submitting other parts or the bid itself via
          secondary channels or whether tendering platforms enable such separation.",Submit some parts separately.
"Requirement
          It MUST be clarified which prospects and limitations exists within a Member State to separate a VCD
          package from the tender itself.",It must be clear what can and cannot be separated in a Member State when making a VCD package for a tender.
"Description
          There are several actors that are involved in the processes related to WP2 and these processes have
          to be defined with regard to trust between the entities involved (e.g.","Some actors work on WP2 tasks, which need clear rules about trusting each other."
"Trust models have to be defined for each process in order to clarify roles and responsibilities during
          transactions.",Define roles for each step.
"On the
          European level it may include the “scope of mutual recognition” for example the trust between the
          national service provider who provides a VCD simple package and the European service provider who
          provides a particular mapping facility.","European level can have mutual recognition, like when one country's service provider trusts another country's service provider."

          includes the roles and responsibilities of the entities involved.","A trust model and system must be defined legally for each process, including roles and responsibilities."
"Description
          “Some documents exchanged during the electronic procurement process have to be legally valid
          following EU Directives.",Documents must be legal after EU rules.
"Directive 2004/18 states that the public procurement procedures and the rules applicable to service
          contests require a level of security and confidentiality higher than that required by Directives.",The public procurement procedures need more security and secrecy.
"Accordingly, the devices for the electronic receipt of offers, requests to participate and plans and
          projects should comply with specific additional requirements.",Devices must follow special rules.
"Moreover, the
          existence of voluntary accreditation schemes could constitute a favourable framework for enhancing
          the level of certification service provision for these devices.” (Bausa O. and Boujraf A.",Accreditation schemes can help improve device certification services.
"This chapter shall include technical requirements that are essential for submitting a VCD via the
        PEPPOL infrastructures.",This chapter has tech needs for sending a VCD through PEPPOL.
"Thereby it connects
        to existing e-business frameworks and value added networks and is being built on existing
        technologies and standards that have been tested and which have proven to be reliable and secure
        for enterprise use.",It connects to old business systems and uses tried-and-tested technology.
"WP2 takes a specific role within the project by concentrating on pre-awarding
        issues where requirements and procedures are often stricter due to principle like equal treatment, nondiscrimination,
        transparency, competition etc.",WP2 focuses on early project issues with strict rules for fairness and equality.
"Although a VCD does not include the offer itself it
        provides several documents that are of great importance for the award of contracts and therewith
        critical for the success of an economic operator for example in cases of disqualification because of late
        delivery of a VCD.","A VCD doesn't have the offer, but it has important documents that help with getting contracts and are crucial for business success."
"An overall pre-condition for using the infrastructure and WP2 solutions in long term is that they are
        governed even after the project lifetime by maintaining and sustaining its functions.",Infrastructure and solutions must be maintained after the project ends.
"Authentication is an essential feature of WP2 as a Virtual Company Dossier contains several
        documents that contain sensitive data about an economic operator.",WP2 has important security to keep secret company info safe.
"Hence, it has to be ensured that
        only those persons that have sufficient rights are able to access and retrieve these data.",Only people with enough rights can get this data.
"Authentication of origin is also an important feature with regard to non-repudiation, for example when
        submitting a VCD to a contracting authority.",Knowing where something comes from is important so you can't deny it later.
"Authentication is a verification of evidence of identity; for individuals and companies identifiers are
        used to process authentication.",Identity checked.
PEPPOL will need to design an authentication system that serves its purposes.,PEPPOL needs an authentication system.
"Time-stamping shall ensure that the submission of a VCD is adequately documented for example to
        verify that it has been sent or received previously to the closure of a call for tender.","Time-stamping shows when something was sent or received, so we can check if it was done before a deadline."
"Moreover there are several actors involved in the WP2 scenarios which need to be connected to the
        PEPPOL infrastructure thus a sufficient allocation of identifiers, in connection with the identity an actor
        claims to have, has to be ensured.",Several actors need IDs that match their claimed identities.
"This shall ensure that unauthorized usage of an individuals’ identity
        is avoided.",This will stop people from using someone else's ID without permission.
"Overall we see a need for commonly monitored identity and access management in
        particular for all national VCD solutions and for the PEPPOL infrastructure thus both approaches
        should be aligned and should make use of the same mechanisms through for example single-sign-on
        functionality.","We need a common way to manage identities and access, especially for national systems and PEPPOL."
"Apart from functionalities like addressability and discovery, the infrastructure should provide access
        points to support the actors or services to connect to the infrastructure.",The infrastructure should have places for actors or services to connect.
"The PEPPOL infrastructure will
        make it possible to exchange electronic business documents in a secure and reliable manner.",Make electronic documents safe and reliable.
"Thus
        also the VCD should be able to be submitted through the PEPPOL infrastructure.",VCD can be sent through PEPPOL.
"We also assume
        that a VCD in stages 2 and 3 can be potentially submitted through other means but this is up to the
        choice of an economic operator and should not be promoted because bypassing the infrastructure is
        critical from the viewpoint of using validation services to ensure confidentiality of a VCD and its
        contained documents (WP1) and secure and reliable transport ensured through the PEPPOL
        infrastructure (WP8).","We assume that a VCD can be submitted in stages 2 and 3, but only if an economic operator chooses to do so."

"Therefore WP 2 proposes to derive criteria from the European
          directive 2004/18/EC as shown for instance within the “Eligibility of Tenderers”.",WP 2 wants to get rules from a European law.
"Using formal
          semantics with the proposed technologies as presented in section 4.1.3 below enables several
          advantages (Fensel, Lausen et al.",Using formal semantics helps with many benefits.
Enable mapping: This involves the creation of certain rules and axioms that define how terms or evidences within one Member State map to terms and evidences within another Member State,Make a map: Create rules for matching things in one country with things in another.
Enable alignment: Refers to the commitment that has to be made in order to determine correspondences between concepts.,Make a choice to match ideas together.
"Alignment is used to find classes of data that are semantically equivalent, but indeed not necessarily logically identical (e.g.",Data with same meaning can be different.
Enable translation: Refers to syntactic rewriting and semantic rewriting to support the translation between two different representations of data.,Translate data.
Enable merging: Describes the creations of a common model that is used instead of the national models.,Use one model for all.
Merging different national models into a unified one is an approach for semantic integration which is particularly used when national models overlap significantly over a common domain.,Merging similar models together helps with understanding.
"For enabling machines to process data directly, database objects have to be mapped into a system of URIs.",Machines need URIs to process data.
URIs using a global naming convention to identify resources thus they are central for semantic interoperability.,URIs help computers find things.
Resources are associated with a URI so that anyone can link / refer to it and may access an appropriate representation of it.,Resources have a special address so people can find and use them.
RDF provides a standard form for representing semantics of data which can be processed by machines.,RDF helps machines understand data.
The RDF metadata model allows to define statements about resources by using so called triple stores (subject-predicate-object expressions).,RDF lets you say things about things using three-part sentences.
Resources in RDF are connected to specific URIs that allow to derive information about the resource and its meaning.,Resources have special addresses that tell us what they mean.
OWL is designed to enable applications to process the content of information instead of just presenting information to humans.,"OWL lets apps work with info, not just show it to people."
The main idea of OWL is to support an efficient representation of ontologies as well as the support of decision procedures.,OWL helps with ontology and makes decisions easier.
OWL allows to refer to terms in other ontologies and it uses the linking provided by RDF to enable the distribution of ontologies among different systems,OWL lets you use terms from other systems.
Logical reasoning is needed to ensure the consistency and correctness of data sets.,Data needs to be correct and same.
It is used to infer conclusions that are not explicitly stated but are consistent with and required by a known set of data.,It's used for drawing conclusions from given facts.

        semantic model that enables a standardized classification and mapping between them (pre-VCD
        mapping tool).",The VCD needs a standard way to match evidence from different countries.
"If the contracting authority specifies the relevant evidences which are related to criteria,
        the data can be processed automatically in order to look-up the evidences required within another
        Member State.",The authority says what evidence is needed and we can use it to find more evidence in another country.
"The aim is to support basic interoperability and exchange of documents on the
        lower maturity levels and leading towards direct electronic exchange of evidence in the higher maturity
        levels.","Support simple document sharing at first, then move to direct electronic proof sharing later."
"The VCD shall ensure that a significant part of the public procurement processes can be made
        through electronic cross-border transactions.",The VCD will make some public buying easy across borders online.
"Therefore the national focus of a VCD needs to be
        enhanced through a cross border perspective.",The national focus should be improved by looking at both sides of the border.
"A VCD provides a single point of contact for an economic operator that enables him to invoke and
        manage different services to create a VCD.",A VCD helps someone use many services at once.
"The VCD services merge data from
        several sources into a single container and make this data available and understandable to the actors
        involved.",VCD combines many sources of data into one place for everyone involved to use.
"Economic operators will be enabled to perform checks with regard to the existence and
        validity of the requested evidences in the VCD package.",Economic operators can check if evidence exists and is valid.
"Structural data of evidence will provide
        guidance for foreign contracting authorities to understand the evidences contained within a VCD and
        they can trust that general information since it is provided by national VCD service providers that take
        the role of trusted parties.",National VCD service providers give trustworthy information about evidence in a VCD.
"Context specific data will be provided on the higher levels to increase
        decision support.",Higher levels get more information to help make decisions.
There are also some weaknesses that can be identified for the overall concept.,Some weaknesses exist.
"The development of standards and context
        specific vocabularies is time consuming and requires long term involvement of user groups that will
        make use of these standards.",It takes a lot of time and many people to create standards that others will use.
"The VCD contains several different kinds of evidences and to develop
        common standards for each one cannot be a major task and focus of this work package and should be
        done by initiative such as CEN BII, BRITE, XBRL or ECRIS.",The VCD has different kinds of evidence. We won't make it a main job to create common standards for each one. Others will do this work.
"Since CEN BII workshop is close to an
        end it will probably not work out to do this development within its scope.",CEN BII workshop is almost over so we can't finish this project in time.
"Nevertheless we will start to
        develop comm of contents and marginal variances in their contents.",We'll start developing content communication.
"Furthermore we rely on structural
        data of evidences that describe and characterize evidence from a more generic point of view.",We use general information to understand evidence better.
"The “selective translation” could be
        arranged in multiple languages in particular when context specific data belongs to a common agreed
        dictionary of expressions.",Translation can be done in many languages if the words are in a shared dictionary.
"Thus the resolution of language
        barriers and linguistic issues cannot be completely managed by a VCD in short term and may require
        adding official translations beside selective translations.","Language barriers can't be fully solved quickly with a VCD, so we need both official and selective translations."
"This direct information exchange would provide many
        opportunities with regard to increase the actuality of evidence, to lower the transaction costs of the
        parties involved and to reduce the time to create a VCD.","This helps share info quickly, saving time and money."
"Nevertheless such direct exchange is very
        difficult to establish because a lot of entities and attestation services have to be federated, access
        policies have to be developed, legal uncertainties have to be resolved and political guidelines have to
        be considered.",It's hard to set up direct exchange because many things need to be done first.
"To circumvent these problems the VCD provides in particular in stage 4 a guideline on
        how to move forward in order to reach this ambitious aim but it will not be a major focus of a VCD as
        such.",The VCD gives guidance in stage 4 to help achieve the goal.
The VCD will be dependent on a number of services that rely on manual and semi-automated input.,The VCD relies on some inputs.
"Thus the VCD system will be primary a tool for the economic operator to arrange a VCD package
        instance which is conform according to the requirements stated in particular call for tender which he
        can fill through additional inputs.",The VCD system helps operators create packages that meet specific requirements.
"A direct access to attestation via the national VCD service provider
        can only be provided for those public attestations that are already available in electronic format.",Direct access is only given for electronic public attestations.
"The
        VCD will not enforce any development of electronic attestation on a national level as this is a clear
        national duty and is depended upon the development of context specific data.",VCD won't make rules for electronic proof at a national level because it's up to each country.
"Nevertheless existing
        attestations may be extended through additional annotations that describe these documents
        generically (structural data of evidences).",Existing attestations can be made longer with more descriptions about the documents.
Unclear yet is the role of Member States that have already implemented Article 5224.,Role unclear of states that did this.
"The scope of
        mutual recognition needs to be further clarified with regard to acceptance of these procedures across
        borders and the liability of those trusted third parties across borders.",Clarify what is accepted on both sides.
"It needs to be further defined how
        a VCD can support countries that have implemented Article 52 but since there are currently no pilots in
        our work package that have such procedures already implemented we have left this out of scope.",We don't know how a VCD supports countries with Article 52 because we don't have any examples to study.
"Neverton representations (context specific data) for evidences that have an, easy structure,
        low quantityheless we see a great opportunity to combine both ideas as shown in stage 4.",We can use simple data with easy structures and not many things.
"In the long-run the VCD should be able to adequately fulfil the
        contracting authorities’ need to proof conformance to certain criteria for qualitative selection and
        exclusion while reducing the burden of proof for the Economic Operator.",The VCD will meet the authorities' needs by proving quality and reducing paperwork.
"The same burden lays on contracting authorities who
        have to check for each evidence whether the issuer has appropriate rights within that country to
        provide evidence.",Contracting authorities must check if issuers have the right to give evidence in their country.
"Furthermore the possibility to re-use evidences that are still valid (time) and the
        maintenance of a VCD will again provide possibilities for cost reductions at the side of the economic
        operator.",Using old evidence and keeping records can help reduce costs.
"A paradigm shift towards electronic exchange of evidence and a next generation of attestations and
        certificates that are currently barely available in electronic form may be promoted by a VCD.",A VCD can promote electronic exchange of evidence and new kinds of digital certificates.
"At least
        the structural representation of attestation will provide benefit for the entities involved by providing
        transparency about the tendering requirements and the evidences that have to be submitted in cross
        border procedures.",The structure helps companies know what's needed and when.
"In contrast a VCD package contains the data necessary to prove the suitability of an economic
        operator according to these requirements.",VCD package has what's needed to show if an operator is suitable.
"Challenges to be dissolved when facing in particular the European perspectives of a VCD are
        mentioned by (Siemens_and_Time.lex 2008):",Challenges dissolve when facing Europe's views on VCDs.
"The
      report lists requirements that scope a potential solution according to the different levels of maturity and
      generic requirements.",The report lists what is needed for a solution.
"These requirements now have to be taken further into account in order to
      specify the VCD and implement the various stages.",Consider these requirements when making a VCD plan.
"To facilitate management of the requirements,
      they will be transformed into a spreadsheet with information as shown in Table 11.",They will put the requirements into a table.
"A distinction will be
      made among functional requirements, non-functional requirements and requirements that specifically
      refer to the development process.","Functional needs, other needs, and process needs will be separated."
"Maintaining them over the project lifetime
      will ensure that the requirements are complete, explicitly defined, clearly described, numbered and
      referenced.",Keep them throughout the project to make sure all needs are clear.
"Further characteristics to evaluate the quality of requirements will be considered such as
      their determinability (atomic character), verifiability (well defined measurement towards the fulfilment of
      a requirement), traceability (tracking of complete fulfilment as well as of where a requirement emerged
      from) and consistency (conflicts between requirements such as contrary features or quality aspects).","We will consider how clear, measurable, easy to follow, and consistent the requirements are."
"Taking the PEPPOL development infrastructure guidelines, SCRUM25 or the
      waterfall model (McDermind_and_Rook, 1991) as reference models, the next phase focuses now on
      the detailed design of the VCD concept as presented above.",We focus on designing the VCD idea in detail.
"This phase will further detail the
      requirements through explicit models and artefacts that describe relevant process flows, data
      characteristics and software.",This phase will explain what is needed.
Drafting agreed models requires interdisciplinary work between participants with different skills.,Different people need to work together.
"Software engineers thereby may design a software model for the mapping of evidences together with
      legal experts that ensure the legitimacy of such a model.",Software engineers and lawyers can make a plan for using evidence.
"Furthermore we intend to work closely
      together CEN BII workshop and DG Markt (including Siemens and Time.lex) when drafting these models
      in order to ensure long term sustainability of the solution envisaged.","We will work together with CEN, BII, DG Markt, Siemens, and Time.lex to make sure our plan is sustainable."
"Departing from a description of the current procedure when economic operators
    collect the necessary evidences as proofs of selection and exclusion criteria in public tenders, the
    team of work package 2 has elaborated a four-stage vision for the VCD.",The team made a plan to improve something.
"With the implementation of stage 1, the pre-VCD mapping, a first level of
    interoperability and facilitation to collect the necessary evidences for a public tender in another
    Member State is supported.",Stage 1 helps with collecting evidence for a public tender in another country.
"Throughout the analysis, elaboration and definition of the VCD concept plus the necessary research
    affiliated with this activity, fruitful insights could be collected about dependencies and
    interrelationships, which make this domain rather complex.",The analysis found connections between things in a complicated field.
"The project team is aware of the fact that the VCD concept conceptualised in this report is rather
    generous – especially if we attempt to implement stage 4 of the VCD vision.","The team knows the VCD idea is too big, especially for stage 4."
"A big step towards
    interoperability and cross-border facilitation in the collection of company information of economic
    operators can already be made when implementing the pre-VCD mapping tool.",Make a big step by using the pre-VCD mapping tool.
"Consequently, a recommendation is given to focus implementation on the pre-VCD mapping tool for
    widespread application of a VCD at first hand.",Use the pre-VCD mapping tool first.
"They form the test cases for a wider
    rollout of the VCD concept as developed throughout phase 1 of work package 2 within PEPPOL.",They make test cases for a bigger use of VCD in PEPPOL.
